# Agent 97 Documentation

## Overview

**Agent 97** is an AI-powered medical education assistant that provides reliable health information from 97 carefully vetted medical sources. It combines the OpenAI Agents SDK with a robust health assistant backend powered by Claude, delivering comprehensive medical education with strict safety guardrails.

## Purpose

Agent 97 answers health education questions for patients and the public:

- **General Health Education**: "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"
- **Medication Information**: "What are the common side effects of metformin?"
- **Preventive Care**: "What health screenings should I get at age 50?"
- **Emergency Detection**: Automatically identifies and redirects emergency situations
- **Mental Health Support**: Provides crisis resources when needed

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Health Education Query

**Input:**
```python
response = await agent.query("What are the early warning signs of a heart attack?")
```

**Output:**
```
Early warning signs of a heart attack include:

**Common Symptoms:**
- Chest discomfort or pressure
- Pain radiating to arms, neck, or jaw
- Shortness of breath
- Cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness

**When to Seek Help:**
Call 911 immediately if you experience these symptoms...

### Example 2: Emergency Detection

**Input:**
```python
response = await agent.query("I'm having severe chest pain and can't breathe")
```

**Output:**
```
ðŸš¨ **MEDICAL EMERGENCY - CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY** ðŸš¨

Your symptoms require immediate medical attention.

1. Call 911 now or have someone call for you
2. If prescribed, take nitroglycerin as directed
3. Chew an aspirin if not allergic
4. Stay calm and wait for emergency services

Do not drive yourself to the hospital.
```

### Example 3: Medication Information

**Input:**
```python
response = await agent.query("What should I know about taking ibuprofen?")
```

**Output:**
```
Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for pain relief...

**Common Uses:**
- Pain relief
- Fever reduction
- Inflammation reduction

**Important Considerations:**
- Take with food to reduce stomach upset
- Typical adult dose is 200-400mg every 4-6 hours
- Maximum daily dose is 1200mg without medical supervision

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Agent not responding"
```bash
# Check MCP server is running
ps aux | grep "agent_97.mcp.server"

# Verify API keys
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**Issue**: "No citations in responses"
```bash
# Verify Anthropic web tools are enabled
# Check that trusted_domains are configured
cat src/config/domains.yaml | head -20
```

**Issue**: "Guardrails blocking valid queries"
```python
# Try different guardrail mode
agent = PatientAssistant(guardrail_mode="regex")
```

**Issue**: "Slow responses"
```python
# Check API latency
# Review logs for timeout issues
# Consider reducing max_tokens
```

## Performance
