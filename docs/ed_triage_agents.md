# Emergency Department Triage Agents Implementation

## Use Case Overview

The Emergency Department (ED) Triage system implements a multi-agent clinical decision support framework designed to assist triage nurses in rapidly assessing patient acuity, identifying critical conditions, and prioritizing care delivery in busy Canadian emergency departments. The system leverages the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) standards and integrates with hospital-specific resources and protocols.

## Clinical Context

### Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS)

The system implements the 5-level CTAS framework as defined in `configs/agents/templates/ctas_config.yaml`.

**CTAS Configuration Structure (`ctas_config.yaml:4-89`):**
```yaml
ctas_levels:
  1:
    name: "Resuscitation"
    description: "Conditions that are threats to life or limb requiring immediate aggressive interventions"
    target_time: "Immediate"
    color: "blue"
    examples:
      - "Cardiac arrest"
      - "Major trauma with altered vital signs"
      - "Unconscious/unresponsive"
    red_flags:
      - "No pulse or breathing"
      - "GCS < 9"
      - "Systolic BP < 80"
      
  2:
    name: "Emergent"
    description: "Conditions that are potential threats to life, limb or function"
    target_time: "15 minutes"
    color: "red"
    examples:
      - "Chest pain (cardiac features)"
      - "Severe trauma"
      - "Altered mental status"
```

Each level includes:
- **Target time**: Maximum wait before physician assessment
- **Red flags**: Critical vital sign thresholds
- **Examples**: Common presentations at each level
- **Indicators**: Key assessment criteria

## Agent Workflow

### 1. Patient Presentation Flow

```
Patient Arrives at ED
        ↓
Triage Nurse Input → System
        ↓
[Orchestrator Agent Activated]
        ↓
Parallel Assessment:
├── Red Flag Detection
├── CTAS Level Assessment
└── Initial Workup Planning
        ↓
Synthesized Triage Decision
        ↓
Nurse Review & Action
```

### 2. Data Input Structure

The system accepts patient data including:
- **Demographics**: Age, sex/gender
- **Chief Complaint**: Primary reason for visit
- **Vital Signs**: BP, HR, RR, Temp, SpO2, Pain scale
- **History**: Present illness narrative
- **Symptoms**: List or description
- **Medical History**: Relevant past conditions
- **Medications**: Current prescriptions
- **Allergies**: Known allergies

### 3. Agent Coordination Process

The orchestrator follows a structured assessment sequence defined in the configuration.

**Orchestrator Instructions (`configs/agents/templates/triage_orchestrator.yaml:17-24`):**
```yaml
Assessment Process (IMPORTANT: Call each tool exactly ONCE):
1. First, call detect_red_flags ONCE to identify any critical symptoms
2. Then, call assess_triage_level ONCE to determine CTAS level  
3. Finally, call suggest_initial_workup ONCE to recommend initial tests
4. Synthesize all findings into a comprehensive triage report

CRITICAL: Do NOT call any tool more than once. Each tool provides a complete assessment in a single call.
```

**Main Assessment Function (`src/agents/clinical/orchestrator.py:136-198`):**
```python
async def run_triage_assessment(
    patient_data: Dict[str, Any],
    session_id: Optional[str] = None,
    trace_id: Optional[str] = None,
    langfuse_enabled: bool = True,
    streaming: bool = False
) -> TriageDecision:
    """Run a complete triage assessment using the orchestrator and specialist agents."""
    
    # Create the orchestrator
    orchestrator = create_triage_orchestrator()
    
    # Format patient data as string for the agent
    patient_info = _format_patient_data(patient_data)
    
    # Run the orchestrator with specialist tools
    result = await Runner.run(
        orchestrator,
        input=patient_info,
        max_turns=4  # 3 tool calls (one per specialist) + 1 final response
    )
    
    # Return the structured output
    if isinstance(result.final_output, TriageDecision):
        return result.final_output
```

## Critical Decision Points

### Red Flag Override Logic

**Decision Framework (`configs/agents/templates/triage_orchestrator.yaml:30-33`):**
```yaml
Decision Framework:
  - If red flags are CRITICAL: Override to CTAS 1-2
  - If red flags are HIGH: Consider CTAS 2-3
  - Use clinical judgment to balance all assessments
  - When in doubt, triage UP for safety
```

### Time-Sensitive Conditions

The system screens for critical symptoms defined in the CTAS configuration.

**Critical Symptoms Configuration (`configs/agents/templates/ctas_config.yaml:91-116`):**
```yaml
critical_symptoms:
  cardiovascular:
    - "Chest pain with radiation to jaw/arm"
    - "Crushing chest pressure"
    - "Syncope with palpitations"
    - "Severe dyspnea with chest pain"
    
  neurological:
    - "Sudden severe headache (thunderclap)"
    - "Facial droop"
    - "Slurred speech"
    - "Unilateral weakness"
    - "Sudden vision loss"
    
  respiratory:
    - "Stridor"
    - "Unable to speak in full sentences"
    - "Use of accessory muscles"
    - "Cyanosis"
```

### Clinical Pearls Integration

The workup suggester includes clinical decision support:
- Ottawa ankle/knee rules
- PERC criteria for PE
- HEART score for chest pain
- Canadian Head CT rules

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Chest Pain Presentation

**Input Structure**:
```python
patient_data = {
    "age": 65,
    "sex": "male",
    "chief_complaint": "Chest pain for 2 hours",
    "vitals": {
        "blood_pressure": "150/90",
        "heart_rate": 95,
        "respiratory_rate": 20,
        "oxygen_saturation": 94,
        "pain_scale": 7
    },
    "symptoms": ["crushing chest pressure", "sweating", "nausea"],
    "medical_history": ["hypertension", "diabetes", "smoker"]
}
```

**System Processing**:

1. **Data Formatting (`orchestrator.py:260-330`)** converts to:
```
DEMOGRAPHICS: Age: 65, Sex: male
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain for 2 hours
VITAL SIGNS: BP: 150/90, HR: 95, RR: 20, SpO2: 94%, Pain: 7/10
SYMPTOMS: crushing chest pressure, sweating, nausea
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: hypertension, diabetes, smoker
```

2. **Agent Assessments**:
   - `RedFlagAssessment`: CRITICAL level, cardiac features
   - `CTASAssessment`: Level 2 (Emergent), confidence: 0.9
   - `WorkupPlan`: Immediate ECG, troponin, cardiac monitoring

3. **Final TriageDecision**:
```json
{
  "final_ctas_level": 2,
  "urgency": "Emergent",
  "red_flags_identified": ["Cardiac chest pain features"],
  "initial_actions": ["ECG within 10 minutes", "IV access", "ASA"],
  "recommended_tests": ["ECG", "Troponin", "CBC", "BMP"],
  "estimated_wait_time": "15 minutes",
  "disposition": "Acute cardiac area - requires immediate physician assessment",
  "confidence": 0.9
}
```

### Example 2: Minor Injury

**Input**:
```python
patient_data = {
    "age": 25,
    "sex": "female", 
    "chief_complaint": "Ankle injury playing soccer",
    "vitals": {
        "blood_pressure": "120/75",
        "heart_rate": 70,
        "pain_scale": 4
    },
    "symptoms": ["ankle swelling", "difficulty weight bearing"]
}
```

**System Response**:
- Red flags: None identified
- CTAS Level: 4 (Less Urgent)
- Actions: Ice, elevation, pain management
- Tests: Ankle X-ray per Ottawa rules
- Disposition: Fast track area

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Metrics

The system tracks:
- **Accuracy**: Agreement with expert triage nurses
- **Safety**: Over-triage rate for critical conditions
- **Efficiency**: Time to triage decision
- **Consistency**: Inter-rater reliability

### Continuous Improvement

- Regular CTAS guideline updates
- Hospital-specific protocol integration
- Feedback from triage nursing staff
- Outcome correlation analysis

## Safety Guardrails

### Clinical Disclaimers

**Built-in Safety Messages (`triage_orchestrator.yaml:41-42`):**
```yaml
Remember: This is for triage decision support only, not diagnosis.
Always recommend "Requires physician assessment" in disposition.
```

### Fallback Protocols

**Error Handling with Safe Defaults (`orchestrator.py:237-248`):**
```python
# Return safe default on error
return TriageDecision(
    final_ctas_level=1,  # Highest acuity for safety
    urgency="Resuscitation",
    red_flags_identified=[f"System error: {str(e)}"],
    initial_actions=["Immediate physician assessment", "Manual triage required"],
    recommended_tests=["As per physician assessment"],
    estimated_wait_time="Immediate",
    disposition="Resuscitation area - immediate physician assessment",
    clinical_summary=f"System error during assessment - defaulting to highest acuity",
    confidence=0.0
)
```

### Audit Trail

**Langfuse Tracing Implementation (`orchestrator.py:201-210`):**
```python
# Update Langfuse trace with results if available
if langfuse_trace:
    langfuse_trace.update(
        output=result.final_output.model_dump(),
        metadata={
            "ctas_level": result.final_output.final_ctas_level,
            "confidence": result.final_output.confidence,
            "red_flags_count": len(result.final_output.red_flags_identified),
            "token_usage": getattr(result, 'usage', None)
        }
    )
```
