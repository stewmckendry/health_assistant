# Emergency Department Triage Agents Implementation

## Use Case Overview

The Emergency Department (ED) Triage system implements a multi-agent clinical decision support framework designed to assist triage nurses in rapidly assessing patient acuity, identifying critical conditions, and prioritizing care delivery in busy Canadian emergency departments. The system leverages the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) standards and integrates with hospital-specific resources and protocols.

## Clinical Context

### Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS)

The system implements the 5-level CTAS framework:

1. **Level 1 - Resuscitation**: Immediate intervention required
   - Target time: Immediate
   - Examples: Cardiac arrest, major trauma with altered vitals
   
2. **Level 2 - Emergent**: Potential threat to life/limb
   - Target time: 15 minutes
   - Examples: Chest pain with cardiac features, severe dyspnea
   
3. **Level 3 - Urgent**: Could progress to serious problem
   - Target time: 30 minutes
   - Examples: Moderate trauma, acute psychosis
   
4. **Level 4 - Less Urgent**: Related to age/distress/deterioration potential
   - Target time: 60 minutes
   - Examples: Minor trauma, chronic back pain
   
5. **Level 5 - Non-Urgent**: Acute but non-urgent conditions
   - Target time: 120 minutes
   - Examples: Prescription refills, minor wounds

## Agent Workflow

### 1. Patient Presentation Flow

```
Patient Arrives at ED
        ↓
Triage Nurse Input → System
        ↓
[Orchestrator Agent Activated]
        ↓
Parallel Assessment:
├── Red Flag Detection
├── CTAS Level Assessment
└── Initial Workup Planning
        ↓
Synthesized Triage Decision
        ↓
Nurse Review & Action
```

### 2. Data Input Structure

The system accepts patient data including:
- **Demographics**: Age, sex/gender
- **Chief Complaint**: Primary reason for visit
- **Vital Signs**: BP, HR, RR, Temp, SpO2, Pain scale
- **History**: Present illness narrative
- **Symptoms**: List or description
- **Medical History**: Relevant past conditions
- **Medications**: Current prescriptions
- **Allergies**: Known allergies

### 3. Agent Coordination Process

The orchestrator follows this assessment sequence:

```python
# Step 1: Critical symptom screening
red_flags = await detect_red_flags(patient_data)

# Step 2: Acuity assessment with red flag context
ctas_level = await assess_triage_level(
    patient_data,
    red_flags=red_flags
)

# Step 3: Workup planning based on acuity
workup = await suggest_initial_workup(
    patient_data,
    ctas_level=ctas_level,
    red_flags=red_flags
)

# Step 4: Synthesis and decision
final_decision = synthesize_assessments(
    red_flags, ctas_level, workup
)
```

## Critical Decision Points

### Red Flag Override Logic

When critical red flags are detected:
- **CRITICAL level** → Automatic CTAS 1-2 assignment
- **HIGH level** → Consider CTAS 2-3 with immediate action
- **MODERATE level** → Review for potential escalation
- **LOW/NONE** → Proceed with standard assessment

### Time-Sensitive Conditions

The system specifically screens for:
- **Cardiovascular**: MI, PE, aortic dissection
- **Neurological**: Stroke, seizure, meningitis
- **Respiratory**: Airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax
- **General**: Shock states, severe allergic reactions

### Clinical Pearls Integration

The workup suggester includes clinical decision support:
- Ottawa ankle/knee rules
- PERC criteria for PE
- HEART score for chest pain
- Canadian Head CT rules

## Output Components

### 1. Triage Decision Elements

```json
{
  "final_ctas_level": 2,
  "urgency": "Emergent",
  "red_flags_identified": [
    "Chest pain with cardiac features",
    "Elevated troponin risk"
  ],
  "initial_actions": [
    "Immediate ECG",
    "IV access",
    "Cardiac monitoring"
  ],
  "recommended_tests": [
    "ECG",
    "Troponin",
    "CBC",
    "Basic metabolic panel"
  ],
  "estimated_wait_time": "15 minutes",
  "disposition": "Acute care area - requires immediate physician assessment",
  "clinical_summary": "Cardiac chest pain presentation requiring emergent evaluation",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

### 2. Disposition Recommendations

Based on CTAS level:
- **Level 1**: Resuscitation room - immediate physician
- **Level 2**: Acute care area - rapid assessment
- **Level 3**: Treatment area - urgent evaluation
- **Level 4**: Fast track/minor treatment
- **Level 5**: Waiting room - non-urgent queue

### 3. Initial Actions by Acuity

**CTAS 1-2**:
- Immediate vital signs
- IV access establishment
- Cardiac/respiratory monitoring
- Priority lab/imaging orders

**CTAS 3**:
- Complete triage assessment
- Pain management consideration
- Baseline diagnostics

**CTAS 4-5**:
- Standard registration
- Comfort measures
- Routine assessment queue
