## Design Decisions

### ðŸ§  Key Decisions Made

1. **Parent-Child Chunking Strategy**
   - Parent chunks: 2500 tokens (10k chars) for context
   - Child chunks: 500 tokens (2k chars) for precision
   - 100 token overlap to maintain continuity

2. **Control Tokens**
   - Format: `[ORG=cpso] [TOPIC=screening] [DATE=2025-03-03] [TYPE=policy]`
   - Prepended to parent chunks for enhanced retrieval

3. **Metadata Schema**
   - Tracks effective_date, updated_date, published_date
   - Topics auto-extracted from content and URL
   - Policy levels for CPSO (expectation vs advice)

4. **Supersession Logic**
   - Newer documents automatically mark older ones as superseded
   - Based on topic match and effective date comparison
   - Maintains reference to superseding document

5. **Database Design**
   - opa_documents: Document metadata and supersession tracking
   - opa_sections: Parent and child chunks with embeddings
   - ingestion_log: Track processing status
   - query_cache: Performance optimization

## Resolved Issues & Decisions

1. **Embedding Model**: âœ… Using text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions) - confirmed working
2. **Chunk Sizes**: âœ… 2500/500 tokens working well for policy documents
3. **Database Schema**: âœ… Fixed content â†’ section_text column name
4. **Chroma Metadata**: âœ… Fixed by converting lists to comma-separated strings
5. **Vector Dimensions**: âœ… Fixed mismatch by re-embedding with correct model

## Open Questions

1. **PDF Handling**: PyPDF2 basic extraction - need OCR support for scanned PDFs?
2. **Web Crawling**: Should we follow links to related pages automatically?
3. **Update Frequency**: How often should corpus be refreshed?
4. **Caching Strategy**: What should be cached and for how long?
5. **Rate Limiting**: Optimal settings for different source websites?

## Bugs Fixed

1. âœ… **BeautifulSoup copy() error** - Removed unnecessary copy operation
2. âœ… **Database schema mismatch** - Fixed content â†’ section_text column
3. âœ… **Import path errors** - Fixed after code reorganization
4. âœ… **Chroma metadata error** - Converted lists to strings
5. âœ… **OpenAI API key not found** - Loaded from root .env file
6. âœ… **FastMCP on_event error** - Removed non-existent lifecycle hooks
7. âœ… **Vector dimension mismatch** - Re-embedded with text-embedding-3-small
8. âœ… **Vector search 0 results** - Removed invalid metadata filters
