Experience s with Severe \nAcute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)  in 2003 and pandemic H1N1 virus  in 2009 , as well as events related to \ninadequate sterilization and disinfection of medical equipment, have underscored the notion that every person \nis vulnerable if proper safeguards are not in place to prevent the transmissio n and acquisition of infection.  \nThe face of infection prevention and control is rapidly changing with new infections being described ; more \noutpatient procedures being performed ; new products and medical equipment being manufactured ; and new \nstandards, dire ctives and guidelines being developed by provincial, national and international organiza tions.  \nIt is incumbent on a physician to protect individuals within his or her clinical office  practice. This responsibility is \nnot restricted to patients, but rather, includes clinical office  staff and other visitors as well. Both from a \nstructural and functional point of view there are ample opportu nities for infection to be transmitted in an office \nsetting. Infectio us agents are  not only spread person -to-person, but c an also be spread indirectly through \ninanimate objects known as fomites , and the waiting room of a clinical office practice may be a source for many  \ncommunicable diseases . As such, protective mechanisms must be in place, not only in direct patient \nmanageme nt but in handling of the clinical office  environment as well.  \nThese best practices will outline : \n principles of infection prevention and control in a  clinical  office setting  \n legislation relating to clinical office practice and duties of physicians as emplo yers and supervisors  \n issues to consider when setting up a new clinical office  \n rationale and tools for screening and risk assessment for infection  \n recommendations for providing a clean clinical office  environment  \n guidance for  reprocessing of reusable medica l equipment  \n protection and safety issues related to staff  \nAbout  This Document  \nThese infection prevention and control best practices for physician s are not intended to  replace a physician’s \nbest clinical judgement, but will assist  physicians with their clinical office -based practice . Some components \nhave been derived from legislation and regulations, and will state in explicit terms what physicians should or \nshould not do. Other sections  are evidence -based best practices, intended  to increase  awareness about  the day-\nto-day risks of infection acquisition and transmission in a physician ’s clinical office  and to equip physicians  with \npractical guidance  and tools to minimize such risks.  \nBy employing these best practices as part of routine care and knowing how to respond to the threat of infection \nin an expected fashion (e.g., implementing seasonal screening for acute respiratory infections) , the risks \nassociated with serious infectious disease outbreak s will be mitigated , the level  of practice in clinical office  \nsettings will be elevated and the public will be protected by minimizing the risk of infection transmission.  \n \nThere is an expectation by the public that the level of care and patient safety provided in a  clinical  office \nsetting is equivalent to that provide d in a hospital setting.  \n \n \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  5 \nFOR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS DOCUMENT:  \nShall indicates mandatory requirements based on legislated requirements or national standards (e.g., \nCanadia n Standards Association – CSA).  \nMust indicates best practice, i.e., the standard of care based on current recommendat ions in the medical \nliterature.  \nShould  indicates a recommendation or that which is advised but not mandatory.  \nMay indicates an  advisory or optional statement.  \nIllustrations and Symbols  \nThe following symbols  are used thro ughout the document:  \n \n Recommendations  are annotated with this symbol.

Best Practices for Infection Prevention  \nand Control for Clinical  Office  Practice  \n \n \nTERMS USED IN THIS DOCUMENT (see glossary for details and examp les) \nHealth Care Provider:  Any person delivering care to a patient . \nStaff:  Anyone conducting activities within a clinical office setting  (includes health care \nproviders) . \nClinical Office  Setting:  Any community location where health care is provided, inclu ding settings where \nemergency care is provided, outpatient clinics, community health centres and clinics, \nphysician offices,  independent health facilities, and out-of-hospital premises . \n \n1. Legislation Relating to I nfection Prevention and \nControl Practice s in the Clinical Office  \nA. The Occupational Health and Safety Act  (OHSA)  \nProviders of clinical office care have a responsibility to have systems in place with established policies and \nprocedures that protect the health and safety of workers in their workp lace.  Preventing transmission of \nmicroorganisms to other patients is a patient safety issue, and preventing transmission to staff is an \noccupat ional health and safety issue. The consistent and appropriate use of Routine Practices (see Glossary ) by \nall heal th care providers will lessen microbial transmission in the clinical office setting . Examples include having \npoint -of-care alcohol -based hand rub (ABHR) and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) readily \navailable and that the use of sharps is com pliant with the Needle Safety Regulation  (O. Reg 474/07) , available at:  \nwww.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/070474 . \nDepending on the setting in which they are working, a physician may have different r oles and responsibilities under \nthe Occupational Health and Safety Act  (OHSA ). He or she may be an employer , a supervisor  or a worker  under the \nAct (see box, below) . In some instances, a physician ma y have more than one role  at the same time : \n A physician is an employer  if he/she employs one or more workers or contracts for the services of one \nor more workers . \n A physician is a supervisor  if he/ she has charge of a workplace or authority over any worker.  \n A physician  is a worker if he/ she performs work or supply services for monetary compensation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  8 SCENARIO  \nDr. Brown is a joint owner of a family health clinic  and works with two physicians and nine employees. She \nteaches family medicine residents in h er office and they join her on hospital rounds and assist with procedures \nin the ambulatory clinic. Dr. Brown is also employed part -time by the university student health centre. Dr. Brown \nis thus an employer, a supervisor and an employee. She has differing  responsibilities  in each of these roles : \n Employer:  of emp loyees in her health care team  \n Supervisor: of employees in her office and the family medicine residents in her office, and at the hospital  \n Worker: as an employee at the university.  \n \n \nDuties of Empl oyers   Make sure workers know about hazards and dangers by providing information, \ninstruction and supervision on how to work safely . \n Appoint a “competent person” as defined by the OHSA to be a supervisor.  \n Make sure supervisors know what is required to prote ct workers’ health and safety \non the job . \n Create workplace health and safety policies and procedures (where more than 5 \nworkers are regularly employed) . \n Make sure everyone follows the workplace health and safety policies and procedures . \n Make sure workers w ear and use  the right PPE. \n Maintain equipment, material and protective devices in good condition.  \n Comply with applicable legislation and reporting requirements . \n Do everything reasonable under  the circumstances to protect workers from being \nhurt or getting a work -related illness . \nDuties of Supervisors   Inform workers about hazards and dangers , and respond to their concerns.  \n Show workers how to work safely, and make sure they follow the law and \nworkplace health and safety policies and procedures . \n Make sure wo rkers wear and use the right PPE. \n Do everything reasonable under  the circumstances to protect workers from being \nhurt or getting a work -related illness.  \nDuties of Workers   Comply with the OHSA and its regulations and the workplace ’s health and  safety \npolic ies and procedures.  \n Work and act in a way that won’t  hurt themselves or anyone else.  \n Report any hazards or injuries to the supervisor/employer . \n Wear and use the PPE required by the employer.  \n \n \n 1. The employer , supervisor  and the worker have duties under  the Occupational \nHealth and Safety Act . \n \n \n \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  9 Additional requirements  under the  Occupational Health and Safety Act1 include : \n A joint health and safety committee shall be implemented  in any workplace that regularly employs 20 or \nmore workers  [s. 9(2)(a)].  \n A health and safety representative is required at a workplace where six or more workers are regularl y \nemployed, and where there is no joint committee [s. 8(1)] . The representative shall  be chosen by the workers . \n No matter how small the workplace, it shall be inspect ed at least once a month [s. 8(6)] . \n \n Monthly Inspection Checklist for Clinical Office S afety  \nVisit all areas of the work place, looking for hazards that need correction, such as:  \n are sharps containers  overfilled?  \n is PPE (gloves, masks, gowns)  available and accessible?  \n is PPE in good condition?  \n are chemical dis infectants/ sterilants labelled  and stored properly?  \n are food preparation areas clean  and dedicated for that purpose ? \n is there adequate ventilation if liquid disinfectants are used?  \n is storage shelving in good condition?  \n is there adequate liquid soap available at hand washing sinks?  \n is th ere alcohol -based hand rub at point -of-care?  \n is the protocol for disposal of hazardous waste  being followed ? \n is the waste collection area clean and tidy, with waste covered?  \n are blood/body fluid spills cleaned by trained staff as they occur?  \n A guide to th e requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act  is available at:  \nwww.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/ohsa/index.php . \n The Needle Safety Regulation  (O.Reg 474/07 )2 has requirements related to the use of hollow -bore needles \nthat are safety -engineered. The regulation is available at : www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/0 70474 . \nB. The Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System \n(WHMIS)  \nThe Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System ( WHMIS ) is a national hazard communication standard  \nexemplified in Onta rio Regulation 860  of the Occupational Health and Safety Act.3 \nThere are three key elements:  \n cautionary labelling of containers of hazardous  substances, called “controlled products ”, e.g., \ndisinfectan ts \n provision of material safety data sheets (MSDS)  for all hazardous substances , which shall be renewed \nevery three years  \n worker education programs.  \n \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  10  2. Employers shall  uphold WHMIS standards in their workplace. Every physician \nmust  therefore familiarize  himself or herself with the legislation.  \n3. Employers shall ensure that the setting is a safe work environment that protects \npatients, staff and themselves and is in accordance with federal and provincial \nlegislation.  \n For more information on WHMIS:  www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/whmis/  \n \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  11 2. Staff Education and Training  \n \nRegular education (including orientation and continuing education) and support shall be provided in all clinical \noffic e setting s to help staff consistently impleme nt appropriate infection prevention and control (IPAC) \npractices. Effective education programs emphasize:  \n the risks associated with infectious diseases, including acute respirator y infection and gastroenteritis  \n the importance of appropriate immunization  \n hand hygiene, including the use of alcohol -based hand rubs and hand washing  \n principles and components of Routine Practices as well as additional transmission -based preca utions \n(Additional Precautions)  \n assessment o f the risk of infection transmission and the appropriate use of PPE, including safe \napplication, removal  and disposal  \n reprocessing of reusable medical equipment  \n appropriate cleaning and /or disinfection of  surfaces or items  in the health care environment.  \n \n 4. Regular education (including orientation and continuing education) and support \nshall be provided in clinical office practices to help staff consistently implement \nappropriate infection prevention and control (IPAC) practices.  \n  \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  12 3. Transmission of Mi croorganisms in Clinical Office S etting s \nUnderstanding the mode of transmission of infection is necessary for practic ing and designing IPAC  strategies. \nThere are five main routes by which  microorganism s are  spread  (Figure 1): \n contact  transmission  (direct  or indirect)  \n droplet transmission  \n airborne  transmission  \n vehicle  transmission  \n vector -borne transmission.  \n \n \n   \nContact Transmission  \nfrom Hands ( Direct) or Objects (Indirect)  Droplet Transmission (up to 2 metres)  \nfrom Coughing or Sneezing  \n  \n  \nAirborne Transmission  (> 2 metres)  Vehicle  Transmission  Vector -borne \nTransmission  \nFigure 1: How microorganisms are spread  \n \nAlthough vector borne  spread is not likely to be of relevance in a  clinic al office setting, the other mechanisms are \nall important modes of transmission in a physician ’s office.  \n  \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  13 \n4. Routine Practices  \nRoutine Practices are based on the premise that all patients are potentially  infectious, even when asymptomatic, \nand that the sa me standards of practice must  be used routinely  with all patients to prevent exposure to blood, \nbody fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, non -intact skin or soiled items and to prevent the \nspread of microorganisms . \nAdherence to Routine P ractic es protects not only the health care provider  but also staff and patients who may \nsubsequently be in contact with that health care provider . \nElements of Routine Practices include:  \n Risk Assessment  of the patient and the health care provider’s interaction w ith the patient  \n Hand Hygiene  according to the “ 4 Moments ” as described in Ontario’s Just Clean Your Hands Program4 \n Cont rol of the Environment , including appropriate accommodation, equipment repro cessing, \nenvironmental cleaning, safe handling of sharps  and issues relating  to construction and renovation  \n Administrative Controls (i.e., management of staff health and practices) , including encouraging staff \nimmu nization, respiratory etiquette and audits of practice  \n Personal Protective Equipment  (PPE)  to protect staff . \n For more information about Routine Practices, see PIDAC’s Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in \nAll Health Care Settings ,5 available at: \nwww.publich ealthontario.ca/en/eRepository/RPAP_All_HealthCare_Settings_Eng2012.pdf . \n \n Recommendation : \n1. All health care providers must follow Routine Practices for all patients  during all \ncare in all clinical office settings . \nA. Risk Assessment and Screening  \n \n For each patient encounter, h ealth care providers must screen the patient to \ndetermine whether the patient has a communicable disease and to assess the risk of \nexposure to blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions and non -intact skin and identify \nthe strateg ies that will decrease exposure risk and prevent the transmission of \nmicroorganisms.  \n \nThe first step in the effective use of Routine Practices is to perform a risk assessment  (Figure  2).5 \nA point -of-care risk assessment is applied before every interaction  with the patient and at all stages of the \ninteraction with the patient , including : \n at the time of booking  (if appropriate , e.g., same day or next day appointment ) \n upon  arrival in the waiting room  \n in the examination room.  \n For more information on patient screening, see Section 4.D,  Booking, Reception and Placement . \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  14  \n \n \nFigure  2: Screening and Risk Assessment Steps to be Performed by a Health Care Provider to Determine an Individual’s Risk of \nTransmission of Infectious Agents and the Rationale for Associated Protective Measures  \nWhere there is a risk of transmission of infection based on the risk assessment , interventions and controls  may \nbe put into place to reduce one’s risk of acquiring or transmitting infection  (see Appendix A ). While hand hygiene \nis always required, the risk assessment will indicate when  PPE is to be worn . For example:  \n exposure to blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions or non -intact skin:  \n hands exposed   WEAR GLOVES  \n clothing or forearms  exposed  WEAR A GOWN  \n mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, mouth  exposed WEAR A MASK AND EYE PR OTECTION  \n exposure to contaminated equipment or surfaces  WEAR GLOVES and possibly  a GOWN.

Hand Hygiene  \nHand hygiene relates to the removal of visible soil and removal or killing of transient microorganisms from the \nhands while maintaining good skin integrity.  \n \n Hand hygiene is considered the most important  and effective IPAC  measure to \nprevent the spread of health care -associate d infections.  \n \nAll clinical office setting s must implement a hand hygiene program that incorporates the following elements :6 \n To make it possible for health care providers to clean their hands at the right time, alcohol -based hand \nrub or a hand washing  sink with soap and water must be provided at the point -of-care , i.e., within arm’s -\nlength of the patient.  \n Education is provided  to health care providers about when a nd how to clean their hands . \n Moisturizers compatible with the hand hygiene products used are made available to staff , to help \nmaintain s kin integrity.  \n Patient hand hygiene is supported.  \n \nAlcohol -based hand rub (A BHR ) is the preferred method to routinely decontaminate hands in clinical situations \nwhen hands are not visibly soiled .6 ABHR provides for a rapid kill of most transient microorganisms  (Figure 3), is \nless time -consuming than washing with soap and water and is easier on skin. While the action of hand rubbing \nfor 15 seconds is equivalent to the time spent in hand washing, the busy health care provider can do other things \nwhile hand rubbing (e.g., converse with the patient). An additional benefit is that the patient sees th e health care \nprovider cleaning his /her hands, something that is often appreciated.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA: HCW hand imprint after \nexamining pati ent B: HCW hand imprint after \ncleaning with ABHR  (From NEJM, Donskey, C.J ., Eckstein B.C., The \nHands Give It Away, Volume 360, e3.

Alcohol -\nbased hand rub should be provided for patients and visitors  in the waiting area  to \nreduce the risks of environmental contamination with respiratory viruses , \ngastrointestinal viruses and antibiotic -resistant organisms (AROs)  such as methicillin -\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) or vancomycin -resistant enterococci ( VRE) . \n1.

These have \nalso been known as “transmission -based precautions ”. \n \nMany infections for which Additional Precautions are indicated are reportable under the Health Protection and \nPromotion Act . These infections shall  be reported to public health to enable appropriate investigation and case \nfinding. See Appendix F for a list of reportable diseases in Onta rio. \nIf you suspect an outbreak of a reportable  disease after  seeing a cluster of patients with a given infection or \nsymptom complex, report this to your local public health  unit. Frontline health care providers are key to timely \nand effective disease prev ention in their local communities . \n For more information about Additional Precautions, refer to  PIDAC’s Routine Practices and Additional \nPrecautions  in All Health Care Settings , available at: \nwww.publichealthontario.ca/en/eRepository/RPAP_All_HealthCare_Settings_Eng2012.pdf . \n Locate public health unit s: www.phdapps.health.gov.on.ca/PHULocator/ . \nA. Contact Transmission and Precautions  \nContact Precautions are used in addition to Routine Practices for microorganisms where contamination of the \nenvironment or intact skin is a particular consideration. Co ntact transmission is the most common route of \ntransmission of infectious agents. There are two types of contact transmission:  \n Direct contact  occurs through touching.  \n Indirect contact  occurs when microorganisms are transferred via contaminated objects.  \nMicroorganisms transmitted by contact transmission include antibiotic -resistant organisms ( AROs ) such as \nmethicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), vancomycin -resistant enterococc i (VRE), extended -spectrum \nbeta -lactamase (ESBL) –producing bacteria, ca rbapenemase -producing Enterobacteriaceae  (CPE) ; scabies; and \nsome  agents of infectious diarrheas , such as Clostridium difficile  and norovirus . \nFor patients with infections spread by contact , consider the following:  \n See the patient at the end of the day, if  clinical status allows.  \n Quickly triage symptomatic  patient s out of the common waiting areas and move the patient to an \nexamining room. If this is not possible, segregate the patient away from others.  \n Wear gloves for any patient contact and for contact wit h items touched by the patient. Wear a gown for \ndirect contact or if soiling of clothing is likely.  \n At the end of the office visit, disinfect  all horizontal surfaces in the examination room that have been in \ncontact with the patient, as well as equipment u sed to examine the patient (blood pressure cuff, \nstethoscope, etc.) , with a low -level disinfectant , or a wipe  impregnated with a low -level disinfectant . \n It is recommended that the charts of patients with ant ibiotic -resistant organisms be fl agged to facilit ate \nrecognition on subsequent visits.  \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  31 B. Droplet Transmission and Precautions  \nDroplet Precautions are used in addition to Routine Practices for patients known or suspected of having an \ninfection that can be transmitted by large respiratory droplets. Drople t transmission occurs when droplets \ncarrying an infectious agent (e.g., pertussis ) exit the respiratory tract of a person. Droplets can be generated \nwhen he or she talks, coughs or sneezes and through some procedures performed on the respiratory tract (e.g ., \nsuctioning, bronchoscopy or n ebulized therapies). These droplets are propelled a short distance (less than two \nmetres) and may enter the host’s eyes, nose o r mouth or fall onto surfaces. Studies  suggest that droplets forcibly \nexpelled from a cough or sn eeze travel for up to two metres.12 \nFor patients with infections spread by dr oplets, consider the following:  \n Make every effort to see the patient at the end of the day, if clin ical status allows.  \n Quickly triage the patien t out of the common waiting areas and move the patient to an examining room. \nIf this is not possible, segregate the patient at least two metres away from others.  \n Provide a surgical face mask for the patient to wear at all times while in all areas of the clinical office . For \npractices with a large p ediatric component, pediatric masks  are now available.  \n Keep masks, eye protection and a hand hygiene agent on hand for the receptionist to use as soon as \nhe/she encounter s a patient  requiring Droplet Precautions.  \n Encourage patients to practice respiratory etiquette.  \n Place alert signage at the en trance of the examination room.  \n Wear a surgical mask and eye protection when in d irect contact with the patient.  \n Add Contact Precautions when caring for patients  with acute  respiratory infection, as contaminatio n of \nthe environment is likely.  \nC. Airborne Transmission and Precautions  \nAirborne Precautions are used in addition to Routine Practices for patients known or suspected of having an \nillness transmitted by the airborne r oute.13 \nAirborne transmission occurs when airborne particles remain suspended in the air, travel on air currents and are \nthen inhaled b y others who are nearby or who may be some distance away from the source patient, in a \ndifferent room (depending on air currents) or in the same room that a patient has left, if there have been \ninsufficient air exchanges.13 Control of airborne transmission requires control of air flow through special \nventilation systems and the use of N95 respirators.13 Microorganisms transmitted by the airborne route are \nMycobacterium tuberculosis  (TB), varicella virus (chickenpox ) and measles virus.  \n \n 5. Clinical office settings that use respirators shall have a respiratory protection \nprogram in place. The program shall include a health assessment, N95 respirator \nfit-testing and staff training in the proper way to perform a seal -check.  \n \nConsideration should be given to making special arrangements for patients with suspected or confirmed \npulmonary  tuberculo sis, chickenpox (active or in the incubation period) and measles:  \n Make every effort to see t he patient at the end of the day, if clinical status allows.  \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  32 \n Quickly triage the patient out of the common waiting areas and move the patient to an examining room. \nIf possible, the patient should enter and exit through a separate entrance and go directly in  and out of \nthe examina tion room.  \n Provide a surgical face mask for the patient to wear at all times while in all areas of the clinical office . For \npractices with a large p ediatric component, pediatric masks  are now available  for purchase . \n Keep the door to the treatment/ exam room closed . Visitors and staff should not  enter the room unless they \nare immune to the disease (where immunity is an option). Open a window in the room, if this is possible . \n Place alert signage for staff on the closed door.  \n The health c are provider entering the patient’s room must wear a  fit-tested  N95 respirator  for care of \npatients with active pulmonary tuberculosis . An N95 respirator is not necessary if the health care \nprovider has  documented immunity  to the suspected airborne infecti on, i.e., chickenpox or measles . \nOnly immune staff should provide care to patients with chickenpox or measles.  \n Allow sufficient time for the air to change in the room and be free of droplet nuclei before using the \nroom for another patient (for tuberculosis ) or for a non -immune patient (for measles and chickenpox ). \nThe time required may be minimized if the patient has worn  a surgical mask consistently.  \n Routine cleaning for the room or  equipment is sufficient after examining a patient under Airborne \nPrecautio ns. \n ",

If both pulmonary tuberculosis and a respiratory virus are suspected in a single individual, a \ncombination of Airborne, Droplet and Contact Precautions must  be used.  \nAt the end of the office visit, disi nfect all horizontal surfaces in the examining room that have been in contact \nwith the patient, as well as equipment used to examine the patient (blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, etc.) , with \na low -level disinfectant , or a wipe impregnated with a low -level  disinfectant . \nE. Antibiotic -resistant O rganisms (ARO)  \nColonization and infection with strains of bacteria  that are resistant to commonly -used antibiotics (e.g., MRSA, \nVRE, ESBL, CPE) are becoming more prevalent in health care, including community, acute a nd long -term  care \nsettings. These patients/ residents may require follow -up or routine care in a physician’s clinical office. It is \ntherefore important to recognize how AROs can be transmitted and precautions that can be taken to minimize \ntheir spread.  \n1. Antimicrobial  Stewardship  \nMany AROs are associated with the use of antibiotics. For example, the risk of MRSA has been related to the duration \nand frequency of prior antibiotic use.14,15 In additio n, excessive use of antibiotics is thought to promote the spread of \nMRSA by reducing resistance to colonization in patients and by giving resistant strains a survival advantage . \nEffective antibiotic man agement includes:  \n avoidance of inappropriate or excessive antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis  \n ensuring that antibiotics are given at the correct dosage and for an appropriate duration  \n reducing the use of broad -spectrum antibiotics, particularly third -genera tion cephalosporins and \nfluoroquinolones, to what is clinically appropriate.  \n For information about Ontario’s antimicrobial stewardship program for hospitals, visit:  \nwww.publichealthontario.ca/en/BrowseByTopic/InfectiousDiseases/AntimicrobialStewardshipProgram/Page\ns/Antimicrobial -Stewardship -Program.aspx . \n \n The single most important mode of transm ission of antibiotic -resistant \nmicroorganisms in a clinical office setting  is via transiently colonized hands of health \ncare workers, who acquire it from contact with colonized or infected patients, or after \nhandling contaminated material or equipment . \n2. Communication  \nGood communication with other health care settings regarding the status of a patient who has had, or who will \nhave, contact with them is important:  \n If a patient is identified with an ARO following discharge home, the patient or family physic ian must  be \nnotified of the results.  \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  34 \n If an individual is identified as being a contact of a patient with an ARO following transfer to another \nfacility  or after being discharged home, the receiving health care facility , family physician or physician \nmost re sponsible for care must be notified of the exposure  in order to make decisions regarding \nadditional follow -up. \n If a family physician identifies a patient with a new ARO following recent hospitalization/ prior to \nhospitalization or entry into a long -term car e home, he /she must notify the receiving facility of the results.  \nSharing a patient’s condition with other health care providers shall be done within the parameters of the \nPersonal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), available at:  www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/04p03 . \n \n Implied consent is permitted under PHIPA if there are reasonable grounds to believe \nthat the disclosure of personal health information will eliminate or reduce a \nsignificant risk of harm to others.

Reprocessing Methods  \nThere must  be written  procedures  for cleaning and disinfection/sterilization of equipment/ devices that are kept \nnear the reprocessing area. Procedures must  be reviewed and revised regularly.  \n \n 13. The reprocessing method, level and products required for medical \nequipment/devi ces shall reflect the intended use of the equipment/device and \nthe potential risk of infection involved in the use of the equipment/device.49 \n  \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  51 \nThe repro cessing method and products required for medical equipment/devices will depend on the intended use \nof the equipment/device and the potential risk of infection involved in the use of the equipment/ device. The \nprocess and products used for cleaning, disinfec tion and/or sterilization of medical equipment/devices must be \ncompatible with the equipment/devices .48 See Appendix K , Reprocessing Options for Clinical Offices/Clinics , for \nmethods of reprocessing that are available based on the minimum level of reprocessing required.  \nThe classification system developed by Spaulding50 (Table 2) divides medical equipment /devices into three \ncategories, based on the potential risk of infection involved in their use . \n \n The level of reprocessing required for medical equipment/devices is determin ed by \nSpaulding’s criteria ( Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Spaulding's classification of medical equipment and required level of processing  \nClass  Use Minimum Level of \nReprocessing  Examples  \nCritical  Enters sterile body site, \nincluding the vascular \nsystem  Cleaning followed by \nsterilization   Surgical instruments  \n Biopsy instruments  \n Foot care /podiatry  equipment  \nSemicritical  Comes in contact with non -\nintact skin or mucous \nmemb ranes but does not \npenetrate th em Cleaning followed by h igh- \nlevel disinfection  \nSterilization is preferred   Vaginal specula  \n Endoscopes  \n Anaesthesia equipment  \n Tonometer  \nNoncritical  Touches only intact skin \nand not mucous \nmembranes, or does not \ndirectly to uch the patient  Cleaning followed by low- \nlevel d isinfection (in some \ncases, cleaning alone is \nacceptable)   ECG machines  \n Oximeters  \n Stethoscopes  \n \nC. Single -Use Medical Devices  \nCritical and se micritical m edical equipment/devices labelled as single -use must not \nbe reprocessed and re -used unless the reprocessing is done by a licensed \nreprocessor .48 Examples of critical and semicritical single -use items are syringes, \nplastic vaginal specula and mouthpieces for pulmonary function testing. Currently \nthere are no li censed reprocessors in Canada. There are reproces sors in the USA \nlicensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).  \nClinical office setting s that wish to have their single -use medical equipment /devices \nreprocessed by a licensed reprocessor must  ensure that the reprocessor’s facilities \nand procedures have been certified by a regulatory authority or an accredited \nquality system auditor to ensure the cleanliness, sterility, safety and functionality of \nthe reprocessed equipment /devices.  Single -use medical \nequipment/ devices are \nusually labelled by the \nmanufacturer with this \nsymbol:  \n \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  52 \nD. Requirements for Staff Training  \nIn settings where sur gical procedures are done (including IHF, OHP) and where reprocessing is performed on site, \nthere must be a designated individual(s) responsible for reprocessing, with:  \n training to the level that is required for the volume and complexity of the equipment t o be reprocessed  \n documentation of training, including a training manual that is reviewed annually and updated as required  \n ongoing continuing education.  \nE. Requirements for Reprocessing Space  \nEquipment reprocessing must  be performed in a segregated area awa y from patients and clean areas.  There \nmust be a clearly designated individual who is responsible for reprocessing .48 \nAt a minimum48: \n There must be a designated, segregated area for reprocessing medical equipment /devices . \n The reproc essing work area shall be physically separated from clean areas by cleanable walls or partitions .49 \n Surfaces in the reprocessing area must be easily cleaned and disinfected.  \n Wherever chemical disinfe ction /sterilization is performed, air quality must be monitored when using \nproducts that produce toxic vapours and mists.  \n An eyewash station must be loc ated in the reprocessing area.51 \n A dedica ted hand washing sink must be located in the reprocessing area.  \n There shall be appropriate PPE for staff involved in reprocessing.  \nF. Transport of Contaminated Equipment within Premises  \nTransport of used medical equipment from the procedure area to the rep rocessing area must be done in such a \nway as to avoid contamination of the environment. Closed carts or covered containers designed to prevent the \nspill of liquids must be used for handling and transporting soiled medical equipment /devices. Containers or c arts \nused to transport soiled equipment must be cleaned after each use.  \nG. Instrument Cleaning  \n “Cleaning is always essential prior to disinfection or sterilization. An item that has not \nbeen cleaned cannot be assuredly disinfected or sterilized .” \nPublic Health Agency of Canada/ Health Canada  \n \nReusable medical equipment/devices must be thoroughly cleaned before disinfection or sterilization.52 The \nprocess of cleaning physically removes contaminants from the equipment/device, rather than killing \nmicroorganisms. If an item is not cleaned, soil (e.g., blood, body fluids, dirt) can protect the microorganisms from \nthe action of the disinfection or sterilization process making it ineffective, as well as inactivate the disinfectant or \nsterilant so that it does not work.  \n \n \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  53 Recommendations for clea ning medical equipment/ devices48: \n Follow the instrument manu facturer’s guidelines for cleaning.  \n Staff who handle an d clean contaminated equipment/ devices must wear facia l protection, gloves, \nand gown.49 \n Clean instrument as soon as possible after use so that organic material will not dry on it. If there will be a \ndelay in reprocessing, soak the instrument in an approved instrument soaking solution.  \n Clean instrumen t with an instrument  detergent/ enzymatic diluted according to the detergent \nmanufacturer’s directions or, alternat ively, in an ultrasonic washer.  \n Clean instruments that have lumens with a brush, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The \nbrush must a lso be cleaned and disinfected.  \n Rinse the instrument with water after cleaning to remove residue that might i nterfere with the \ndisinfectant/ sterilant.  \n Dry the instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Drying prevents dilution of \nchemical disinfectants . \n Visuall y inspect the instrument after clea ning and prior to disinfection/ sterilization to ensure cleanliness \nand integrity of the instrument.  \n For information about endoscope reprocessing, see Appendix L, Reprocessing Endoscopy Equipment . \n ",

They are easy to use, often with \nfeatures such as self -sealing closures and chemical indicator strips, and come in a variety of sizes that can accept single \nor small groups of instru ments. The date of sterilization should be marked on the product wrapping . \nI. Sterilization  \nSterilization is the elimination of all disease -producing microorganisms, including spores. Sterilization is used  on \ncritical medical equipment/ devices and, wheneve r possible, semicritic al medical equipment/devices.  \nSee Appendix I, Recommended Minimum Cleaning and Disinfection Level and Frequency for Medical Equipment , \nfor reprocessing requirements for specific items of medical equipment.  \nConsiderations when sterilizing medical equipment/devices:48 \n Develop written policies and procedures for ster ilizat ion of medical equipment/ devices used in the clinical \noffice setting that include cleaning, drying, inspection, disassembly, wrapping, sealing and labelling . \n Ensure that the manufacturer’s instructions for installation, operation, cleaning and preventive \nmaintenance of the sterilizing equipment  are followed . \n Staff must be trained to operate sterilizers.  \n Test a ll sterilizers for performance using physical, chemical and biological monitors and indicators.  \n1. Types of Sterilizers  \nThe preferred method for decon taminati on of heat -resistant equipment/ devices is steam sterilization . Pre-\nvacuum table top sterilizers are recommended for clinic and clinical office settings. Regular preventive  \nmaintenance and cleaning is required to assure the effectiveness of the ster ilizer. Records should be kept of any \npreventive maintenance and repairs performed. Assure distilled water is filled to the correct level and drained \naccording to manufacturer’s recommendations. Check the gasket for defects and deterioration. Assure proper  \nplacement of packs, and do not overload the chamber.  \nDry heat should be used only for the materials that cannot be sterilized by steam. The principle advantage of dry \nheat steriliza tion is its penetrating power. The disadvantages are that heating is slow,  and long exposure times \nand high temperatures are required, which could damage materials.  \nThe manufacturer’s instructions for maintenance and use of sterilizers shall be followed.49 \nUnacceptable  methods of disinfection/ sterilization include:  \n dishwasher (including those with sanitizing cycles)  \n boiling  \n ultraviolet irradiation  \n glass bead sterilizers  \n chemiclave sterilizers  \n microwave ovens  \n \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  55 2. Monitoring the Sterilization Process  \nThe sterilization process  shall  be monitored  to ensure the integrity of the process. A logbook must  be kept for \neach sterilizer load.  Performance monitoring includes physical, biological and chemical indicators (see Glossary ) \nand a ll three processes shall be used:  \n Physical indicat ors (e.g., mechanical printouts from the sterilizer) must be checked and signed for each \nsterilizer cycle by the person sterilizing the instrument . \n A biological indicator (BI) sh all be used to test the sterilizer once each  day the sterilizer is used.  \n An internal chemical indicator shall be placed inside each package, container or bundle that is \nundergoing sterilization . \n If a dynamic air removal -type sterilizer is used, an air  removal test with a Class II chemical indicator shall \nbe performed every day the s terilizer is used . \n For more information about sterilizer monitoring, see PIDAC’S Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and \nSterilization in all Health Care Settings , available at:  \nwww.publichealthontario.ca/en/eRepository/PIDAC_Cleaning_Disinfection_and_Sterilization_2013.pdf . \n 14. The sterilization process shall be tested, monitored with results recorded and \naudited.  \n15. All steriliz ers shall  be tested for performance using physical, chemical and \nbiological monitors and indicators . \n3. Sterilization Failures  \nImproper sterilization  includes, but is not limited to, the following situations:  \n instruments not cleaned properly prior to sterilization  \n the load contains a positive biological indicator  \n an incorrect reprocessing me thod was used on the equipment/ device  \n print -outs on reprocessing equipment indic ate failure to reach correct parameters (e.g., temperature, \npressure, exposure time)  \n chemical indicator and/or monitoring tape has not changed colour.  \n 16. A procedure shall be established for the recall of improperly reprocessed \nmedical equipment/devices . \n  \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  56 PROCEDURE FOR STERILIZATION FAILURE  \n Record all equipment/ devices in each processed load to enable tracking in the event of a recall.  \n Repeat the test. If practical, do not release any items that were proces sed since the last negative test. If \nthis repeat test is negative, and there is no indication of a system m alfunction, continue as normal.  \n If the repeated process indicates a failure:  \n Document the time, date, load description and results of physical, chemi cal and biological \nindicator ( BI) monitoring . \n Contact the sterilizer manufacturer. After repair and maintenance, re -challenge the sterilizer \nwith the BI.  \n Re-sterilize the recalled items once the results of the steril izer indicators are acceptable.  \n Assess t he risk to patients.  \n Establish a procedure for notification of physicians, patients, other facilities and/ or regulatory bodies, \nif indicated.  \n4. Storage of Sterile Equipment/ Devices  \nSteam -sterilized packs must be subject to a drying cycle prior to handli ng and storage. Wrapped packs must  be \ncarefully stored in a clean, dry, dust -free area (closed shelves), not at floor level, away from debris, drains, \nmoisture , sinks  and vermin to prevent contamination and maintain sterility until the time of use. All sto red \nequipment and instruments must  be left undisturbed as much as possible since handling may draw contaminan ts \nin through a wicking effect.  \nUpon  opening the sterile equipment/ device, check that the integrity of the packaging has not been \ncompromised:48 \n Visually inspect for discolouration, dampness,  dust, soil, tears ; if present, send for reprocessing . \n Validate results of chemical tape and internal monitors, if present; if no change in colour, send for \nreprocessing . \n Check for defects in the instrument.  \n5. Shelf Life of Sterile Items  \nFor items reprocessed in the clinical office , if the integrity of the package has been ma intained, the item remains \nsterile. A plastic dust jacket may greatly extend the shelf life of the package and should be used on muslin or \ncrepe wrapped packs. If a sterile tray /package has been purchased and has an expiry date /label, follow \nmanufacturer’s  recommendations and discard when outdated.  \nJ. High -Level Disinfection (HLD)  \nSterilization is always the preferred method  of reprocessing semi -critical medical equipment. However, for items \nthat cannot tolerate sterilization, HLD must  be used . Disinfection  does not destr oy bacterial spores or prions.  \nSee Appendix I, Recommended Minimum Cleaning and Disinfection Level and Frequency for Medical Equipment , \nfor reprocessing requirements for specific items of medical equipment.  \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  57 Instr uments that contact mucous membranes are considered to be semi -critical items . HLD kills vegetative \nbacteria, fungi, enveloped  viruses, and mycobacteria  but does not sterilize , i.e., does not kill bacterial spores or \nprions . High -level disinfectants includ e: \n 2 per cent  glutaraldehyde  \n 6 per cent  hydrogen peroxide  \n 0.2 per cent  peracetic acid  \n 7 per cent  hydrogen peroxide  enhanced action formulation  \n 0.55  per cent  ortho -phthalaldehyde (OPA).  \nRecommendations for high -level disinfection of medical equipment/ device s:48 \n Use high -level disinfectants according to manufacturer’s recommendations . \n Use chemical test strips to determine  whether an effective concentration of active ingredients is present . \n Complete and retain a permanent record of processing.  \n Do not top up prepared solutions with fresh solution.49 \n If manual disinfect ion is performed, cover the container used for disinfection during use.49 Ideally , manual \ndisinfection should be performed in an area that is vented appropriately to protect against toxic vapours . \n Rinse instrument  thoroughly following chemical disinfection , according to the chemical manufacturer’s \ninstructions; the quality of the rinse water (i.e., sterile, filtered or tap water) will depend on the intended \nuse of the device.  \n 17. The clinical office  setting  shall  have ventilation systems  appropriate to the \nprocess/product being used , to protect staff from toxic vapours . \nMany chemical disinfectants have occupational exposure limits that are regulated \nunder the Occupational Health and Safety Act  (R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 833 ). \nIf control measures are not available during reprocessing involving a chemical agent, \nair sampling may be required to ensure that the regulated limit has not been \nexceeded for the chemical being used.  \n18. When reprocessing medical equipment, requirements from the Canadian \nStandards Association (CSA) shall be met . \n19. Use of chemical disinfectants shall comply with regulations under the \nOccupational Health and Safety Act . \nK. Low-Level Disinfection  (LLD)  \nNoncritical e quipment that does not touch mucous membranes and only touches intact skin  (e.g., stethoscopes, \nblood pressure cuffs, baby scales ) require s cleaning and LLD between each patient . See Section 7, Control of  the \nEnvironm ent, for information regarding the use of low -level disinfectants.  \nSee Appendix M for a checklist  for reprocessing medical devices.  \n Recommendation s: \n20. Critical and semi -critical medical equipment/devices labelled as single -use must \nnot be reprocessed and re -used unless the reprocessing is done by a licensed \nreprocessor . \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  58 \n9. Surgical/Invasive Procedures  \nA. Surgical Hand Preparation for Surgical  Settings  \nDue to multiplication of bacteria under surgical gloves and the high percent age of glove punctures found after \nsurgery, a hand hygiene product with a prolonged antiseptic effect on the skin is desirable. In a surgical  setting, a \nsurgical hand rub (using ABHR)  or a surgical hand scrub (using an antimicrobial soap)  with persistent a ntimicrobial \nactivity should be used.  \nAlcohols are effective for preoperative cleaning of the hands of surgical staff. Several ABHRs have been licensed for use \nas a surgical hand rub ; these  formulations also contain long -acting compounds such as chlorhexid ine gluconate . \nFor surgical and invasive procedures, s tudies have shown that antimicrobial soap is more effective than plain \nsoap and  water for  surgical/invasive procedures . Antimicrobial soap  has residual antimicrobial activity and is not \naffected by the  presence of organic material.  \n \n The antimicrobial activity of ABHRs is superior to that of all other currently available \nmethods of preopera tive surgical hand preparation.  \n \nProcedure for hand hygiene before office surgical procedures:  \n Remove all jeweller y. \n Clean  hands up to a minimum of two inches above wrists thoroughly for the length of time \nrecommended by the product manufacturer  (usually two to five minutes).  \n Clean under nails. A disposable manicure stick can be used; nailbrushes are NOT recommended a s they \ncan become contaminated and da mage the skin around the nails.  \n Nails should be short enough to allow thorough cleaning undern eath and not cause glove tears.  \n If soap is used, r inse off and dry hands well.  \n \n Recommendation:  \n21. In surgical settings, hand  hygiene preparations that are formulated for surgery \nmust be used . \nB. Cleaning after Invasive/Surgical Procedures  \nThe surgical suite can become heavily contaminated with  microbes, becoming a risk for patients, unless it is  \nproperly cleaned and disinfecte d. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring a clean surgical environment rests with \nthe employer.  \nEnvironmental cleaning shall be performed by trained staff according to the protocol of the clinical office setting , \nwhich reflects ORNAC standards (now under  the auspices of the Canadian Standards Association) .40 A regular \ncleaning schedule shall be established, posted and documented.  Responsibility for cleaning anaesthetic machines \nand carts should be clearly defined.  \nOperating rooms are cleaned between cases40: \n\n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  59  Any surface and equipment that comes in  direct or indirect contact with the patient or  body fluids is \nconsidered contaminated  and shall be cleaned with a hospital -grade  disinfectant.  \n Cleanup for  surfaces and equipment shall proceed from  the least contaminated to the most  \ncontaminated area . \n After removal of trash, linen and  instruments, the floor area to with in a 1 to  1.5 metre (3 to 4 f eet) \nperimeter around the  operative area should be cleaned if visibly  soiled. The area cleaned shall be \nextended  as required to encompass visibly soiled  areas . \n Mop heads shall be changed after each use.  If a bucket of hospital grade disinfectant  solution is prepared \nfor multiple uses, used  mops shall not be reintroduced into the  bucket . \n Suction containers/liners should be  disposable and wherever possible solidifiers  should be used.  \nContainers shall be disposed of as per  facility  waste management policies . \n Reusable suction containers should not be  used . Suction tubing shall be disposable.  \nEnd of day ( terminal ) cleaning  of each theatre, scrub area, corridor, furnishings and equipment includes40: \n lights and ceiling -mounted tracks  \n door handles and push plates  \n light switches and controls  \n telephones and computer keyboards  \n spot -checking walls for cleanliness  \n the exterior surfaces of all machines and equipment (allo w adequate drying time –according to  \nmanufacturer’s instructions –before storage)  \n all furn iture, including wheels/casters  \n all horizontal surfaces  \n scrub sinks and surrounding walls  \n floors should be mopped with a sufficient amount of disinfectant/ detergent to ensure that the floor \nremains wet for 5 minutes. Each floor shall be thoroughly cleaned using fresh solution a nd a fresh \nmop/mop head . \n floors should be power scrubbed at regular intervals according to established protocols.  \nSterile processing areas that  store sterile supplies are cleaned at least daily (including counters, shelves and floors).  \n Refer to  the Operating Room Nurses Association of Canada (ORNAC) standards for more information about \nenvironmental cleaning in surgical areas, available at : http://shop.csa.ca/en/canada/operating -room -nurses -\nassociation -of-canada/ornac -2013/invt/27031122013 . Note: ORNAC standards are now under the au spices \nof the Canadian Standards Association.  \n Refer to  the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities, Inc. (AAAASF)  standards \nat: www.aaaasf.org/ . \n \n \n \n \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  60 \nC. Surgical Space  \n \n \n \n \n When develop ing space for surgery, the following requirements of the Canadian \nStandards Association shall be met10: \n Operating room perimeter walls, ceiling, and floors, including penetrations, \nshall be sealed. M aterials and finishes shall be seamless, with integral \nsurfaces on the ceilings, walls and flooring. There shall be no floor drains.  \n Operating rooms have minimum 20 air changes/hour, with at least 6 outdoor \nair changes /hour. Positive pressure is maintained  relative to the corridor. For \nminor surgical procedures and endoscopy, there should be a minimum 15 air \nchanges /hour and at least 5 outdoor air changes /hour.  \n Temperature in operating rooms is maintained between 18 C and 23C. \n Surfaces shall be smooth and durable enough to withstand cleaning and \ndisinfection . \n The design shall ensure separate traffic flows for sterile and soiled materials \nand separate storage areas for supplies and equipment.  \n Soiled and clean workrooms or holding rooms shall be separated.  \n All reprocessing shall  be done in a dedicated  medical device reprocessing area . \n Provision shall be made for adequate equipment storage.  \n Two scrub sinks shall be provided near the entrance to each operating room.  \n Hygiene sinks and supplies shall be immediatel y outside of an operating room \nor procedure room.  \n Requirements for Endoscopy  space : \n Endoscopy services shall be designed so that the endoscopy suite is adjacent \nto a medical device  reprocessing  area10 [Section 9.1.2.6] . \n In bronchoscopy suites , there shall be negative pressure relative to the corridor . \n \n  \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  61 10. Administrative Controls  \nAdministrative controls are m easures that are put in place to reduce the risk of infection to staff or to patients . \nThese include IPAC  policies/ procedures, education/ training , healthy workplace policies, immunization and \nexposure management . \nA. Healthy Workplace Policies  \nAll clinical office  settings should establish a clear exp ectation that staff do not come into work when ill with \nsymptoms of infection .53 This includes not working when acutely ill with signs and symptoms likely due to a \ntransmissible infection, such as fever, cough, influe nza-like symptoms, runny nose, sore throat, vomiting, \ndiarrhea, rash or conjunctivitis.  \nHealth care providers who are ill must use their best judgement about working , weighing the risks and benefits \nof working aga inst not providing patient care . If the dec ision is made that the health care provider must work, \nscrupulous hand hygiene and appropriate PPE (e.g., wear a mask if you have a cold) is essential to minimize the \npossibility of transmission of infection.  \nB. Staff Immunization  \nTo protect the health of patients and themselves, it is particularly important that staff be immune to measles, \nmumps, rubella , pertussis , varicella, hepatitis B and receive influen za vaccine annually. Staff should  know their \nimmunization status and have their immunizations up to date. Immunizations appropriate for health care \nproviders include:  \n annual influenza vaccine  \n measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine  (two doses)  or serologic  documentation of immunity  \n varicella vaccine  (two doses) or serologic documentation of immunity  \n hepatitis B vaccine (complete series) and serologic confirmation of immunity for staff who may be \nexposed to blood, body fluids or contaminated sharps in their wo rk  \n tetanus vaccine (every 10 years)  \n acellular pertussis vaccine  (one dose Tdap) . \nSee Appendix N  for Canada’s immunization schedule for staff.  \nC. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)  \nA TST using the two -step skin test is recommended at t he beginning of employment for all persons who work in \nthe clinical office . The TST may be done by the employer or by the employee’s personal physician. A single -step \nTST is sufficient if:  \n there is documentation of a prior two -step test , OR \n there is docume ntation of a negative TST within the last 12 months , OR \n there are two or more documented negative TST results at any time but the most recent was >12 \nmonths ago.  \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  62 Persons who have had a positive TST, or who test positive with the two -step method , should hav e medical \nfollow -up to rule out active disease.  \n Refer to the OMA/ OHA Communicable Disease Surveillance Protocols, Tuberculosis Surveillance Protocol , for \ninstructions for performing the two -step tuberculin skin test. Available at:  \nwww.oha.com/Services/HealthSafety/Documents/TB%20Protocol%20Revised%20Aug%202014.pdf . \nD. Infections in Health Care Providers  \n Refer to the OMA/ OHA Communicable Disease Surve illance Protocols for more informati on regarding staff \ninfections, available at:  \nwww.oha.com/Services/HealthSafety/Documents/TB%20Protocol%20Revised% 20Aug%202014.pdf . \n \nInfections in Health Care Provider s \nBlood -borne Pathogens  \n Physicians performing or assisting in performing exposure -prone procedures must be tested for blood -\nborne pathogens (HBV, HCV and HIV) annually.  Refer to CPSO’s Blood -Borne Path ogens policy:  \nwww.cpso.on.ca/policies -publications/policy/blood -borne -pathogens . \n Health care providers  who have been exposed to blood or body fluids through a specific  incident, such \nas a needle prick or splash , must seek appropriate expert advice regarding the frequency of testing that \nis required to determine if they have been infected with one or more blood -borne pathogens.  \nEnteric Infections  \nHealth care providers  with vomiting and diarrhea should remain at  home . \nHerpes Simplex  \n Cold sore : If possible, keep the lesion covered during patient visits, especially when seeing \nimmunocompromised patients. Avoid touching your face and wash your hands frequently . \n Herpetic whi tlow  (herpetic finger infection): All persons with herpetic whitlow must  be excluded from \ndirect patient contact until the lesion is resolved, as gloves will not guarantee  adequ ate protection for \nthe patient.  \n Shingles : Health care providers  may work, in mo st cases, if the lesions can be covered and good hand \nwashing technique is used. Health care providers  with shingles must not work with high risk patients \n(e.g., newborns, immunocompromised patien ts) until lesions are crusted.  \nInfluenza or other acute res piratory viral infection  \nInfluenza is spread through droplets and contaminated hands. Fever and systemic symptoms (headache, \nmalaise, myalgia) favour a diagnosis of influenza over the common cold. If you have influenza or an \ninfluenza -like illness, refrain  from working until well. If you must work, wear a surgical mask, clean  hands \nfrequently, and take particular care with high risk patients (e.g., immunocompromised, chronic cardiac or \npulmonary disease , pregnant women, infants ). Annual influenza vaccinatio n is the best form of prevention.  \nConjunctivitis  (“pink eye”)  \n Acute bacterial conjunctivitis : Usually presents with muco -purulent or purulent discharge and crusting. \nHealth care providers with bacterial conjunctivitis should not provide care until symptom s have resolved . \n \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  63 Infections in Health Care Provider s \n Viral conjunctivitis : Usually presents with pain in the eye, clear discharge, periorbital swelling and pre -\nauricular adenopathy. Adenovirus is the usual cause of outbreaks of conjunctivitis in health care.  Health \ncare providers with viral  conjunctivitis should not provide patient care from the time of onset of \nconjunctivitis until 14 days after onset. Infected health care providers may continue to provide non -\npatient care duties, provided good hand hygiene is practiced and contact with the  eyes is avoided. \nAdenovirus may survive on surfaces for prolonged periods.  \nE. Employee Exposure Protocol  \nA prompt and organized approach is required when staff are accidentally exposed to blood or body fluids  \nthrough percuta neous (needle stick) or mucou s membrane (splash) accidents. In particular, a decision will have \nto be made about the need to initiate post -exposure prophylaxis.  \nA significant  exposure  is one in which there is an exposure to blood  or a body fluid capable of transmitting HBV, \nHCV and/or  HIV through percutaneous injury from a contaminated needle or other sharp  object, a splash onto a \nmucous membrane or non -intact skin, or a human bite that  breaks the skin .54 See the following box for steps to \nfollow after a significant exposure to blood  or body fluids . \n ",

It \nshould be noted that elderly people and people who are immunocompromised may not have a febrile response \nto a respiratory infection.  \nAdditional  Precautions (AP):  Precautions (i.e., Contact Precautions, Droplet Precautions, Airborne Precautions) \nthat are necessary in addition to Routine Practices for certain pathogens or clinical presentations. These \nprecautions are based on the method of transmis sion (e.g., contact, droplet, airborne).  \nAdministrative Controls: Measures put in place to reduce the risk of infection to staff or to patients (e.g., \ninfection prevention and control policies/procedures, education/training).  \nAirborne Precautions: Used in addition to Routine Practices for patients known or suspected of having an illness \ntransmitted by the airborne route  (i.e., by small droplet nuclei that remain suspended in the air and may be \ninhaled by others).  \nAlcohol -based Hand Rub (ABHR):  A liquid, gel  or foam formulation of alcohol (e.g., ethanol, isopropanol) which \nis used to reduce the number of microorganisms on hands in clinical situations when the  hands are not visibly \nsoiled. ABHRs contain emollients to reduce skin irritation and are less time -consuming to use than washing with \nsoap and water.  \nAntibiotic -Resistant Organism (ARO):  A microorganism that has developed resistance to the action of several \nantimicrobial agents and that is of special clinical or epidemiological significance.  \nAntiseptic:  An agent that can kill microorganisms and is applied to living tissue and skin.  \nAudit:  A systematic and independent examination to determine whether quality activities and related results \ncomply with planned arrangements, are implemented effectively and are  suitable to achieve objectives.  \nBarriers: Equipment or objects used to prevent exposure of skin, mucous membranes or clothing of staff to \nsplashes or sprays of potentially infectious materials.  \nBiological  Indicator (BI): A test system containing viable microorganisms (e.g., spore -laden strips or vials) \nproviding a defined resistance to a specified sterilization process. The sterilizer manufacturer will determine \nwhich BI is appropriate for the specific ste rilizer. BIs shall  be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions \nand records kept of the test results. A BI shall be used to test the sterilizer each day that it is used.  If BI indicates \nthat sterilizat ion has not been achieved, sterility of the instrument(s) cannot be assured. A process shall be in \nplace in the event of a B I failure.  \nBiomedical Waste:  Contaminated, infectious waste from a clinical office setting  that requires treatment prior to \ndisposal  in landfill sites or sanitary sewer systems. Biomedical waste includes human anatomical waste; human \nand animal cultures or specimens (excluding urine and faeces); human liquid blood and blood products; items \ncontaminated with blood or blood products that  would release liquid or semi -liquid blood if compressed; body \nfluids visibly contaminated with blood; body fluids removed in the course of surgery, treatment or for diagnosis \n(excluding urine and faeces); sharps; and broken glass which has come into conta ct with blood or body fluid.43,52  \nChemical I ndicator: A system that responds to a change in one or more predefi ned process variables during the \nsterilization process with a chemical or physical change. Chemical indicators do not necessarily indicate that a \ndevice is sterile but do indicate that the package has been processed through a sterilization cycle. External \nchemical indicators are useful for distinguishing between processed and unprocessed items (e.g., tape that \nchanges colour)  and shall be applied to each package to be sterilized. An internal chemical indicator shall be \nplaced inside each package that is und ergoing sterilization.  \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Of fice Practice | April 2015  67 Cleaning:  The physical removal of foreign material (e.g., dust, soil) and organic material (e.g., blood, secretions , \nexcretions, microorganisms). Cleaning physically removes rather than kills microorganisms. It is accomplished \nwith water, de tergents and mechanical action.  \nContact Precautions:  Used in addition to Routine Practices to reduce the risk of transmitting infectious agents \nvia cont act with an infectious person.  \nContamination:  The presence of an infectious agent on hands or on a surface such as clothes, gowns, gloves, \nbedding, toys, surgical instruments, patient care equipment, dressings or other inanimate objects.  \nContinuum of Care:  Across all health care sectors, including settin gs where emergency (including pre -hospital) \ncare is provided, hospitals, complex continuing care, rehabilitation hospitals, long -term care homes, outpatient \nclinics, community health centres and clinics, physician offices, dental offices, independent healt h facilities, out -\nof-hospital premises, offices of other health professionals, public h ealth and home health care.  \nDetergent:  A synthetic cleansing agent that can emulsify oil and suspend soil. A detergent contains surfactants \nthat do not precipitate in ha rd water and may also contain protease enzymes (see Enzymatic Cleaner ) and \nwhitening agents.  \nDirect Care:  Providing hands -on care (e.g., bathing, washing, turning patient, changing clothes, continence care, \ndressing changes, care of open wounds /lesions, to ileting).  \nDisinfectant:  A product that is used on surfaces or medical equipment /devices which results in disinfection of \nthe surface or equipment /device. Disinfectants are applied only to inanimate objects. Some products combine a \ncleaner with a disinfecta nt. \nDisinfection:  The inactivation of disease -producing microorganisms. Disinfection does not destroy bacterial \nspores. Medical equipment /devices must be cleaned thoroughly before effective disinfection can take place.

Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee (PIDAC) , \nQueen’s Printer for Ontario, January 2011.  \n \nDefinition  \n Staphylococcus aureus resistant to all of the beta -\nlactam classes of antibiotics (such as penicillins, \npenicillinase -resistant penicillins (e.g., c loxacillin) \nand cephalosporins.  \n Community -associated or CA -MRSA refers to \nstrains linked to colonization and  transmission in \nthe community.  \nEpidemiology  \n CA-MRSA  detection is growing globally.  \n Higher risk populations vary geog raphically and \ninclude: young adults, children <2 years, athletes \nin contact sports, those with chronic \ndermatological conditions, those living in \ncongregate or overcrowded conditions or of lower \nsocioeconomic status, injection drug users, \npatients with re cent or recurrent antibiotic use, \naboriginals, men who have sex with men, military \npersonnel, and reside nts of correctional facilities.  \n CA-MRSA may still occur in persons  with no \napparent risk factors.  \n In some areas of the United States, the majority of \nskin and soft tissue S. aureus infections are CA -MRSA . \n The epidemiology and management of MRSA in the \ncommunity may evolve quickly. This was the case in \nparts of the United States. Close monitoring of the \nlocal epidemiology, if available, is important . \nTrans mission and Virulence  \n Transmission occurs through direct contact \nbetween persons or through contact with \ncontaminated objects or surfaces.  \n Some CA -MRSA strains produce toxins associated \nwith more severe systemic and local disease, \nhowever the aetiology of MRSA’s increased virulence \nin the community remains an ongoing debate . Diagnosis and Treatment  \n(See Algorithm ) \nMild and Moderate Disease Presentation  \n Minor skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) do not \nneed to be routinely cultured for MRSA.  \n Cultures ma y be indicated if MRSA is suspected \nbased on patient c haracteristics (see algorithm).  \n Cornerstones of CA -MRSA management are \nincision and drainage of purulent lesions a nd \nproper follow -up wound care.  \n Systemic antibiotic treatment IS NOT \nrecommended for min or SSTIs or small abscesses \nwithout cellulitis except in young infa nts and the \nimmuno -compromised.  \n Systemic antibiotic treatment is recommended for \nsmall abscesses with cellulitis and for larger \nabscesses (see algorithm for choice of antibiotics ). \nSevere o r Unusual Disease Presentation  \n Extensive cellulitis or multiple abscesses wit h \nassociated systemic features.  \n Necrotizing pneumonia, often with an influenza -\nlike prodrome leading t o shock or respiratory \nfailure.  \n Endocarditis  \n Other presentations of MRSA may  include \nosteomyelitis, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, \nseptic thrombophlebitis, and sepsis syndrome.   \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Office Practice | April 2015  87 Prevention of MRSA Transmission  \n Requires consistent application and reinforcement \nof good hygienic practices and judicious use of \nantibiotic s. \n If ski n lesions are present instruct the patient to : \no Cover lesions t o contain drainage or exudates;  \no Not share personal products that are in \ncontact with the skin; for example: \ndeodorant, razors, toothbrushes, towels , nail \nfiles, combs and brushes  \no Not share unwas hed towels;  \no Discard contaminated waste, including used \ndressings, in a safe and timely manner (e.g., \ninto a garbage pail lined with a plastic bag, so \nthe bag can be removed and tied w ithout re -\ncontaminating hands);  \no Wash hands with soap and water or use \nalcohol -based hand rub after touching any \nskin lesions and potentially infected mater ials, \nsuch as soiled dressings.  \n After the patient leaves the examining room, \nimmediately wipe all surfaces and patient care \nequipment (blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, \netc.)  that have been in contact with the patient, \nwith a chlorine bleach solution of 1:100 \nconcentration, or an approved hospital grade \ndisinfectant such as a quaternary ammonium  or \nhydrogen peroxide solution.  \no Hospital grade disinfectant wipes with \napproved hos pital grade disinfectants in easy \ndispense containers are also available (for \nmore information, contact your local public \nhealth unit or Regional Infection Control \nNetwork).  Screening and Decolonization  \n Routine screening for colonization of nares or \nother  sites is NOT recommended.  \n Decolonization should be considered only in \nexceptional circumstances, such as recurrent \ninfections and transmission within a family. This \nshould be done in consultation with an infectious \ndisease specialist.  \n \n  \n \nInfection Prevention and Control for Clinical Office Practice | April 2015  88 Algorithm for Ou tpatient Management of Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (SSTIs) \nin Healthy Adults1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDoes O ne or More of the Following Apply to Your Patient?  \nBelongs to a “population at higher risk” ( see below ) \nRecurrent abscesses/household clusters of abscesses  \nPoor response to beta -lactam classes of antibiotics (e.g., penicillins, cloxacillin, cephalosporins)  \nHistory of recent antibiotic treatment  \nPrevious MRSA infection  \nPopulations at Higher Risk  \nChildren, especially under 2 years  \nClassroom contacts of an MRSA case  \nAthletes, particularly in contact sports  \nPersons with chronic skin disorders  \nMen who have sex with men  \nInjection drug users  \nPersons of lower socioeconomic status  \nPersons living  in congretate or crowded settings  \nPersons exposed to colonized pets, including veterinary workers  \nAboriginals  \nPersons with MRSA carriage  \nNOTES:  \n1.
