  "content": "# Advice to the Profession: Prescribing Drugs\n\n[](#)\n\n**Last Updated: **January 2023\n\n *Advice to the Profession* companion documents are intended to provide physicians with additional information and general advice in order to support their understanding and implementation of the expectations set out in policies. They may also identify some additional best practices regarding specific practice issues.\n\n \n\nWhile prescribing drugs is a standard component of most physicians’ practices, it is also a complex area of clinical care that requires appropriate knowledge, skill, and professional judgment. \n\nThis document is intended to help physicians interpret their obligations as set out in the *Prescribing Drugs *policy and to provide guidance for how these obligations can be effectively discharged. This document also seeks to provide physicians with practical advice for addressing common issues that arise in practice.\n\n***Methadone Maintenance Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder***\n\nMethadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder. Successful outcomes from MMT require knowledge, experience, vigilance, and diligence on the part of the MMT physician, the patient, and all those involved in treatment.\n\nPhysicians must also complete the training necessary to ensure they have the knowledge, skill, and judgment to appropriately prescribe and manage patients through MMT. As with all care and prescribing, physicians will need to exercise sound clinical judgment, taking into consideration the specific needs of their patients. Physicians prescribing methadone for opioid use disorder must do so in accordance with the *Prescribing Drugs* policy and practice in a manner that is informed by relevant opioid use disorder guidelines.1 In particular, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) has developed the [*Canadian Opioid Use Disorder Guideline*](https://www.camh.ca/en/professionals/treating-conditions-and-disorders/canadian-opioid-use-disorder-guideline)*, *a national clinical guideline that standardizes guidelines for Canadian prescribers of opioid agonist therapy, including using methadone.\n\n*Mitigating Risk*\n\nWhen initiating MMT, it is important for physicians to be aware of the elevated risk of death from overdose during the first two weeks of treatment, due to the prolonged half-life and slow bioaccumulation of methadone. As part of initiating treatment, it is important to be clear with patients about what to expect including that it may take several weeks to reach the optimal dose and that more frequent visits may be needed during the first two weeks of treatment particularly where patients are at an increased risk of methadone toxicity. Concurrent uses of other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines, sedatives) or substances (e.g., alcohol) may further increase the risk of death.\n\n*Interprofessional collaboration*\n\nRegular communication and collaboration between MMT prescribers, pharmacists, and other health-care providers will help ensure patient care is safe and of high quality. This collaboration may include the development of policies and procedures to ensure continuity of patient care and secure custody and storage of methadone.\n\nTo optimize care, communication between physicians and pharmacists about the following will be important:\n\n- Determining at the outset of treatment whether the pharmacy is accepting new patients\n- Discussing how and when the pharmacist is to contact the MMT prescriber including how to reach the prescriber for urgent issues after-hours\n- Documenting or relaying pertinent clinical information (e.g., health changes, missed doses, vomited doses, etc.)\n\nThe Ontario College of Pharmacists [*Key Requirements for Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT)*](https://www.ocpinfo.com/practice-education/practice-tools/fact-sheets/methadone/) factsheet summarizes key requirements for dispensing MMT for pharmacists which will help inform how physicians approach their own practice.\n\n*Observing methadone consumption by properly qualified health-care professionals*\n\nThere may be times where methadone is administered (e.g., provided to the patient for consumption) by a health-care professional other than the prescribing physician. Given the risks associated with methadone, this requires the health-care profession to have particular training and education to ensure they have the knowledge, skill, and judgment to do so safely. Given these risks, generally speaking a health-care professional will need to have completed specific training in the specific and appropriate administration of methadone and have demonstrated an understanding of MMT, including the risks associated with methadone.\n\n*Education and training resources*\n\nAs with all areas of practice, physicians must only prescribe methadone if they have the knowledge, skill, and judgment necessary to do so safely and effectively. Physicians and other health-care professionals can obtain the necessary training and education by completing the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health’s [Opioid Use Disorder Treatment course](https://www.camh.ca/en/education/continuing-education-programs-and-courses/continuing-education-directory/opioid-use-disorder-treatment-oudt-course) and [Opioid Dependence Treatment Certificate Program](https://www.camh.ca/en/education/continuing-education-programs-and-courses/continuing-education-directory/opioid-dependence-treatment-odt-certificate-program).2\n\n***“Safer supply” opioid prescribing* **\n\n“Safer supply” opioid prescribing is an emerging area of clinical practice that is grounded in the principles of harm reduction3. It refers to the direct delivery (prescribing) of pharmaceutical-grade opioids to patients with opioid-use disorder as an alternative to the toxic street supply of illicit opioids.\n\nWhile it can take many forms, safer supply opioid prescribing often involves the prescribing of hydromorphone tablets that are consumed by patients and often without direct supervision by a health care professional.\n\nThe College recognizes that providing pharmaceutical-grade alternatives to the toxic street supply, both in the context of a comprehensive treatment plan or as a standalone harm reduction strategy, can enable physicians to support patients with opioid use disorder and reduce their risk of overdose and death. The College also recognizes there have been reports4 that the pandemic has further exacerbated the risks and potential for harm among patients with opioid use disorder. For example, there are indications that the street supply has become increasingly more toxic, leading to a significant increase in opioid related overdoses and deaths and that barriers to access care have worsened as the health care system is under significant strain. As a result, there is a growing interest in exploring emerging or alternative means of treating and supporting this population with an aim to minimize opioid related overdoses and deaths.\n\nAs with all opioid prescribing, it is essential that safer supply strategies be implemented in a manner that minimizes the risk of harm and the introduction of unintended consequences that may negatively impact patients (e.g., misuse, abuse) or the public more broadly (e.g., diversion). The need for caution is heightened in the absence of clinical practice guidelines or strong clinical evidence demonstrating the risks and benefits of a particular approach.\n\nIf considering safer supply opioid prescribing, physicians are reminded of the following expectations of the current *Prescribing Drugs *policy:\n\n- practise within the limits of your clinical competence and/or scope of practice;\n- demonstrate sound clinical judgment, taking into account the individual needs of each patient;\n- consider and apply relevant practice standards, quality standards, and clinical practice guidelines, where they exist;\n- where relevant practice standards, quality standards, and clinical practice guidelines do not exist, or in areas of medicine that are less developed, consider the best available indirect evidence, including clinical trials and evidence-based research to help inform consensus protocols or best practices;\n- review previous interventions the patient has undergone; and\n- develop a comprehensive treatment plan that can help the patient while minimizing risks and unintended consequences (e.g., the risk of diversion).\n\nPhysicians are further reminded that the importance of careful documentation increases as care departs from recommended guidelines and/or moves into areas of medicine that are less developed.*** ***\n\n***Cannabis Authorizations***\n\nFor the purposes of the *Prescribing Drugs* policy, authorizing cannabis for medical use is considered prescribing. Physicians need to follow the expectations set out in the policy, as well as any legislated requirements, including those in [Part 14 of the Cannabis Regulations under the *Cannabis Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2018-144/page-28.html#h-849868). For example, physicians cannot charge a fee for cannabis authorizations.\n\n***Accessing patients’ electronic prescription histories**** *\n\nThe *Prescribing Drugs *policy requires that, prior to initiating a prescription for a narcotic or controlled substance, physicians **must** take reasonable steps to review the patient’s prescription history (provision # 32, e).\n\nAs an example, the policy suggests (but does not require) that this could include reviewing electronic sources of information regarding the patient’s prescription history (e.g., via provincial prescribing databases), where these are available.\n\nAccess to this information at the point of care continues to evolve and many physicians in Ontario are now able to access valuable information about their patient’s prescription histories electronically via the [Digital Health Drug Repository](https://www.ehealthontario.on.ca/en/for-healthcare-professionals/digital-health-drug-repository) (DHDR).\n\nThe DHDR supports authorized healthcare providers’ secure electronic access to a patient’s available drug and pharmacy service information, enabling prescribers to develop the best possible medication history at the point of care.\n\n[Information available via the DHDR](https://forms.mgcs.gov.on.ca/en/dataset/014-5056-87) currently includes:\n\n- dispensed publicly-funded drugs;\n- publicly-funded pharmacy services (e.g., MedsCheck program; influenza vaccinations);\n- non-publicly funded drugs and pharmacy services (e.g., funded by private insurance); and\n- all dispensed monitored drugs, including narcotics and controlled substances (when the approved identification used was a valid Ontario Health number).\n\nThe DHDR is currently available through electronic medical record (EMR) systems certified by Ontario MD and two provincial clinical viewers:\n\n1. [DHDR EMR Integration](https://www.ontariomd.ca/products-and-services/dhdr-emr-integration) (OntarioMD can provide access through your practice’s EMR);\n2. [ClinicalConnect](https://www.ehealthontario.on.ca/en/for-healthcare-professionals/cswo-regional-clinical-viewer-clinicalconnect)5 in **South West Ontario**; and\n3. [ConnectingOntario Clinical Viewer6 in the **Greater Toronto Area**, and **Northern and Eastern Ontario**.](https://ehealthontario.on.ca/en/health-care-professionals/connectingontario)\n\n\r\nFor more information about the DHDR, including information on how to sign up to access these systems, please see [eHealth Ontario’s website](https://ehealthontario.on.ca/en).\r\n\r\nThe College will continue to monitor the landscape for new electronic sources of information regarding patient’s prescription histories and will update this Advice Document to support safe and effective prescribing.\n\n***Considering prescription drug costs***\n\nAvailable research shows that a failure to consider prescription drugs costs at the point of care can have a variety of unintended negative consequences, including that:\n\nFor this reason, physicians may wish to consider on a proactive basis:\n\nThis analysis will be particularly important when a physician has reason to believe that their patient may struggle to afford or be unable to pay for the drug being prescribed.\n\nThe College is aware that physicians do not currently have convenient or up-to-date access to information regarding the cost of prescription drugs. As resources become available to support physicians in considering prescription drug costs, the College will seek to make these resources available.\n\n**Prescription treatment agreements (e.g., “narcotics prescribing contracts”)*** *\n\n­Prescription treatment agreements (sometimes called narcotics prescribing contracts) are formal and explicit written agreements between physicians and patients that delineate mutual expectations for continued prescribing.\n\nTreatment agreements are usually employed to help promote compliance with an agreed-upon set of conditions for the continued prescribing of drugs with a potential for abuse, misuse, and diversion, such as prescription opioids.\n\nAs the proposed benefits of treatment agreements are limited by low-quality evidence, they are not currently required or endorsed by CPSO nor are they recommended by the 2017 Canadian Guideline for Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain; however, physicians may use them in keeping with their own professional judgment.\n\nWhere physicians elect to use treatment agreements in support of safe and effective prescribing, best practice would suggest using them as an educational tool, rather than a punitive one. In this way, treatment agreements may help to ensure that patients understand the circumstances in which they will or will not receive a prescription, while avoiding creating a power imbalance that could undermine the physician-patient relationship.\n\n**Reporting adverse drug reactions or medication incidents**7\n\nPhysicians can help support the ongoing evaluation of prescription drug safety by reporting adverse drug reactions8, suspected adverse drug reactions, and medication incidents9 to the relevant organizations, especially those that are:\n\n- unexpected, regardless of their severity;\n- serious,10 whether expected or not; and\n- related to recently marketed health products (on the market for less than five years).\n\nPhysicians can report adverse drug reactions to Health Canada’s Vigilance Program at http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/vigilance-eng.php and medication incidents through the Institute for Safe Medication Practices Canada: https://www.ismp-canada.org/err_report.htm.\n\nPhysicians can also encourage their patients to report any medication incidents at http://www.safemedicationuse.ca.\n\n***Prescription drug disposal**** *\n\nBecause most community pharmacies have procedures in place to safely dispose of patient returned medications (also called post-consumer waste), it is generally best practice for physicians to direct patients to their local pharmacy to return unused medication.\n\nIn circumstances where a physician takes possession of the patient’s drugs directly or is in possession of any other types of medications (e.g., unused or expired medication samples), physicians can contact a drug disposal company to set up their own contract for safe disposal. Physicians may further consider arranging for the disposal of unused/expired/returned drug samples directly through the pharmaceutical representative or company that has provided them.\n\n## Endnotes\n\n1.
