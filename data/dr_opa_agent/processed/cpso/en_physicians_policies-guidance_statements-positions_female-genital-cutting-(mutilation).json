  "content": "# Female Genital Cutting (Mutilation)\n\n[](#)\n\nFemale genital cutting/mutilation (FGC/M) is internationally recognized as a harmful practice that results in the violation of human rights.^[1](#endnote01) FGC/M refers to procedures that involve the infibulation, excision or mutilation, in whole or in part, of the labia majora, labia minora or clitoris.^[2](#endnote02)\n\nPerforming, assisting in or referring patients for FGC/M procedures is illegal in Canada, as the* Criminal Code* identifies FGC/M as aggravated assault. It is also a criminal act to remove a child under the age of 18 from Canada to perform FGC/M on them.^[3](#endnote03) Performing or contemplating performing FGC/M on anyone under the age of 18 raises child protection concerns, and physicians have a legal obligation to notify child protection authorities if they have reasonable grounds to believe that any child under the age of 18 has undergone, or is at risk of undergoing, an FGC/M procedure, regardless of where the procedure has been or may be undertaken.^[4](#endnote04) Physicians who have reasonable grounds to believe that another physician is performing FGC/M procedures must also report this information to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO).^[5](#endnote05)\n\nMany international, national, and regional bodies, including the Ontario Human Rights Commission, the World Medical Association and The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC), have released statements opposing the practice and participation of physicians in FGC/M.\n\nCPSO strongly condemns the practice of FGC/M and recognizes it as a form of gender-based violence that violates physical integrity and psychological well-being. Physicians will be subject to disciplinary measures if they perform, assist in or refer patients for FGC/M procedures.^[6](#endnote06)\n\nPhysicians play an important role in opposing and denouncing the practice of FGC/M. Physicians can support patients by educating themselves on how to properly manage possible complications related to FGC/M, and by providing culturally sensitive counseling to families about the dangers of the practice.\n\nPhysicians who encounter patients who have undergone FGC/M can obtain guidance from sources such as the SOGC’s comprehensive Clinical Practice Guideline (the Guideline).^[7](#endnote07) Among other things, the Guideline provides direction on legal issues related to the practice, as well as guidance for the management of obstetrical and gynaecological complications related to FGC/M. Physicians can also consult the interagency statement, *Eliminating Female Genital Mutilation*, to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of the practice of FGC/M.^[8](#endnote08)\n\n## Endnotes\n\n^1.
