CALCULATION OF FEE PAYABLE: BASIC UNITS AND TIME UNITS
Except where “nil” is listed opposite the service in the column headed with “Asst”, the amount payable
for the surgical assistant service is calculated by adding together the number of basic and time units
and multiplying that total by the unit fee.
Assistant Unit Fee ................................................................ $12.51
Basic Units: The number of basic units is the number of units listed opposite the service in the
column headed with “Asst”, except
a. where multiple or bilateral surgical procedures are performed during the same anaesthetic,
the number of basic units is that listed in the column headed with “Asst” opposite the service
that describes the major procedure; or
b. where no basic unit is listed opposite the service in the column headed with “Asst” and
where “nil” is not listed opposite the service in the column headed with “Asst”, the number of
basic units is that listed opposite the service under the column headed with “Anae”. This
type of service is only eligible for payment upon authorization by a medical consultant
following submission of a letter from the surgeon outlining the reason the assistant was
required. Submit claims for this type of service using fee code M400B.
Where “nil” is listed opposite the service in the column headed with “Asst”, the assistant’s service is

of time units for the time the replacement assistant is in attendance.
Payment rules:

assistant takes over, the replacement assistant is also eligible for double time units.]
