General PreambleMarch 4, 2024 (effective April 1, 2024)
INTRODUCTION
[Commentary:
The Health Insurance Act and, to a lesser extent, the Integrated Community Health Services
Centres Act, 2023 and the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004, provide the legal
foundation and framework for the Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services (“the Schedule”).
The Schedule lists services insured by OHIP and includes the General Preamble (which
impacts all physicians), Consultations and Visits section (which applies to all specialties) and
specific system and/or specialty sections (including specialty preambles).
The General Preamble provides details about billing requirements for all physicians as follows:
The initial Definitions Section (GP2) begins with general definitions of key terms and phrases
used in the Schedule. Those terms and phrases are italicized throughout the General Preamble
as an indication that further information is available in the Definitions Section. The second
group of defined terms refers specifically to maximums, minimums, and time or unit-based
services.
The information provided in the General Information Section (GP8) is the foundation for the
remainder of the General Preamble. A variety of subjects are reviewed as detailed in the table
of contents. This is followed by the Constituent and Common Elements of Insured Services
(GP13). Next is the section which lists the Specific Elements of Assessments (GP15). The
next section provides information on Consultations and Assessments (GP16) followed by
the section regarding services provided only in Hospitals and Other Institutions (GP40).
The next section focuses on psychotherapy, counselling, and related services, followed by a
similar review of services that involve interviews. The remaining sections include special visits,
surgical assistants’ services, anaesthesiologists’ services, and others as listed in the table of
contents.]

MAXIMUMS, MINIMUMS AND TIME OR UNIT-BASED SERVICES
In this Schedule when the amount payable for a service is described:
a. In terms of a maximum number of services without reference to a specific time period to
which the maximum applies, this means that the maximum refers to a maximum number of
services per patient per day. Those services rendered to the same patient on the same day
in excess of the maximum for that patient on that day are not eligible for payment.
b. In terms of a maximum number of services with reference to a specific time period to which
the maximum applies, the services are calculated per patient and the number of services is
based upon services rendered chronologically. Those services rendered to the same patient
during that specific time period in excess of the maximum for that patient are not eligible for
payment.
c. In terms of a maximum with reference to a specific part of the anatomy, this means a
maximum number of services per patient per day. Those services rendered in excess of the
maximum for that specific part of the anatomy per patient on that day are not eligible for
payment.
d. In terms of a minimum number of services without reference to a specific time period to
which the minimum applies, this means that the minimum refers to a minimum number of
services per patient per day. With the exception of those services listed in the “Diagnostic
Radiology” section of the Schedule or unless specifically stated otherwise, where less than
the number of services required to satisfy the minimum are rendered, the services are not
eligible for payment.
e. In terms of “repeat” or “repeats”, except with respect to repeat consultations or unless
otherwise stated, this means the same service(s) is rendered to the same patient by the
same physician on the same day.
f. In terms of a minimum required duration of time, the physician must record on the patient’s
permanent medical record or chart the time when the insured service started and ended. If
the patient’s permanent medical record or chart does not include this required information,
the service is not eligible for payment.
g. Based upon the number of “units” of service rendered, the physician must record on the
patient’s permanent medical record or chart the time when the insured service started and
ended. If the patient’s permanent medical record or chart does not include this required
information, the service is not eligible for payment.

GENERAL PREAMBLE
GENERAL INFORMATION
[Commentary: Services Insured by OHIP
The Schedule is established under section 37.1 of regulation 552 under the Act. The fees listed
are the amounts payable by OHIP for insured services. Insured services under the Act are
limited to those which are listed in this Schedule, medically necessary, are not otherwise
excluded by legislation or regulation, and are rendered personally by physicians or by others
delegated to perform them where such delegation is authorized in accordance with the
Schedule requirements for delegated services.
Some services are specifically listed as uninsured in regulation 552, section 24 of the Act (see
Appendix A), such as a service that is solely for the purpose of altering or restoring
appearance. Other services may be uninsured depending on the circumstances. An example
of a service which is uninsured in limited circumstances is psychotherapy, which is uninsured
where it is a requirement for the patient to obtain a diploma or degree or to fulfill a course of
study. Other examples of commonly uninsured services include missed appointments or
procedures, circumcision except if medically necessary, and certain services rendered and
documents and forms completed in connection with non-medically necessary requests (e.g. life
insurance application).]
[Commentary: Modifications to the Schedule
Under agreement between the MOH and the OMA, additions, deletions, fee changes, or other
modifications to the Schedule, are made by the MOH following consultation and/or negotiation
with the OMA. Physicians who wish to have modifications to the Schedule considered should
submit any proposals to the Physician Payment Committee (PPC) through the appropriate
clinical section of the OMA.
In the situation where a new therapy or procedure is being introduced into Ontario, and the
physicians performing the new therapy or procedure wish to have a new fee item inserted into
the Schedule, the following process is recommended.
An application for a new fee related to the new therapy or procedure should be submitted by
the appropriate section(s) of the OMA to the PPC for consideration, with documentation
supporting the introduction of this item into the Schedule. The PPC will advise OHIP whether or
not this new therapy is experimental. If the PPC and the MOH agree that the item is
experimental, the service is deemed uninsured (in accordance with section 24 of regulation
552 under the Act), and will not be introduced into the Schedule. If the MOH, on the advice of
the PPC, determines that the new therapy or procedure is not experimental, the fee application
will be handled in the usual manner as detailed above.]
[Commentary: Medical Research
Examinations or procedures for the purpose of a research or survey program are not insured
services, nor are services provided by a laboratory or a hospital that support an examination or
procedure that is for the purpose of research or a survey. The exception to this is that an
assessment conducted to determine if an insured person is suitable for such a program is not
necessarily an uninsured service (see section 24 of regulation 552 under the Act - this is
provided as Appendix A of the Schedule).]
[Commentary: Medical Records
All insured services must be documented in appropriate records. The Act requires that the
record establish that:
1.an insured service was provided;
2.the service for which the account is submitted is the service that was rendered; and
3.the service was medically necessary.
The medical record requirements as found in the Act are listed in Appendix G of the Schedule.]

GENERAL PAYMENT RULES
[Commentary:
Claims for payment must be submitted to OHIP in the form and by the medium (e.g. electronic
data transmission; machine readable input) as set out in sections 38.3 to 38.5 of regulation 552
under the Act and must contain the information required by the regulation and the General
Manager of OHIP. Regulation 552 under the Act can be found at:
http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Regs/English/900552_e.htm.
Claims must be submitted within three months of the date the service was rendered, except in
extenuating circumstances. A claim cannot be accepted for payment unless it meets all of the
technical and formal requirements set out in the Act and regulations.]
1. The fee is payable only to the physician who rendered the service personally, or by the
physician whose delegate rendered the service where delegation is authorized in accordance
with the Schedule.
2. Where more than one physician renders different components of a listed service, only one fee is
payable for that service, and the fee is payable only where the Schedule provides that different
physicians may perform different components of the service.
[Commentary:
Where an insured service contains several components (e.g. surgical procedures that include
post-operative care or fracture care), the components of the service are not divisible among
physicians for claims purposes and the physicians are responsible for apportioning payment
amongst themselves.]
3. Where the Schedule provides that different physicians may substitute for one another in
performing the total service, only one fee is payable for the service.
[Commentary:
When physicians routinely or frequently substitute for each other in providing hospital visits to
registered bed patients in active treatment hospitals, e.g. weekend coverage or daily rounds by
various members of a group, the most responsible physician may claim for all the visits.]
Specialist services
When a service rendered by a specialist comprises part of an insured consultation or assessment that
falls within the scope of his or her specialist practice, the service is not eligible for payment unless the
claim for the service is submitted either:
a. unless otherwise noted, in respect of a service described in the portions of the Consultations
and Visits section of this Schedule that reflects the physician’s Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Canada specialty, as documented in the records maintained by the MOH
for claims payment purposes; or
b. in respect of a service described in this Schedule under the following sub-headings which
can be claimed by any specialty: psychotherapy, counselling, HIV primary care, palliative
care support, hypnotherapy, certification of mental illness, interviews, genetic assessments,
midwife or aboriginal midwife-requested emergency and special emergency assessments,
home care application, or home care supervision.

GENERAL PREAMBLE
GENERAL INFORMATION
When a service rendered by a specialist does not fall within the scope of the specialist’s practice and/
or the specialist is providing primary care in a family or general practice setting, the service is only
eligible for payment when the claim is submitted using the appropriate code from the “Family Practice
& Practice in General” listings.
When more than one assessment is rendered to a patient during the same visit by the same physician
who is qualified in one or more specialties, only one assessment is payable.
[Commentary:
Any additional assessment is not eligible for payment.]
Use of Codes, Prefixes and Suffixes
[Commentary:
Services are generally, but not necessarily, listed by anatomical system or specialty for
convenience.]
The alpha-numeric fee code opposite the service listing in this Schedule must be set out in the claim
submitted, together with the required suffix.
Surgical Codes: In the surgical part of the Schedule, the required suffixes are:
suffix A if the physician performs the procedure;
suffix B if the physician assisted at the surgery; and
suffix C if the physician administered the anaesthetic.

1. is an in-patient of a hospital; or
2. attends a hospital where he or she receives an insured diagnostic service; and
3. within 24 hours of receiving that diagnostic service, is admitted to the same hospital as an in-
patient in connection with the same condition, illness, injury or disease in relation to which the
diagnostic service was rendered.
[Commentary:
1.For those diagnostic services which have both technical and professional components listed
under one fee schedule code, the technical and professional components are claimed
separately. The claim for the technical component is submitted using the fee schedule code
with the suffix B and the claim for the professional component is submitted using the fee
schedule code with a suffix C.
2.The technical component may be listed as either "technical component" or in a column
headed "H" or "T". The professional component may be listed as either "professional

Schedule is only eligible for payment where:
1. the physician has the necessary training and experience to personally render the technical
component of the service; and
2. the physician maintains documentation that describes the process by which the physician
monitors quality assurance in accordance with professional standards.
[Commentary:
1.The physician submitting a claim for the technical component is responsible for the complete
quality assurance process for all elements of the technical component of the service,
including data acquisition, reporting, and record keeping. The physician must be able to
demonstrate the above upon request by the MOH.

Consultation and Assessment Codes
There are four different prefixes used for consultations and assessments listed in the “Consultations
and Visits” section of the Schedule. The codes with the “A” prefix are described as the “General
Listings”. These must be used when submitting a claim for consultations and assessments except in
the following situations when the code listed below must be used:
1. acute care hospital – non-emergency in-patient services – “C” prefix codes;
2. long term care institution – non-emergency in-patient services – “W” prefix codes;
3. emergency department – services rendered by a physician on duty – “H” prefix (H1- codes); or
4. rehabilitation unit – services rendered by a specialist in Physical Medicine – “H” prefix codes
(H3XX codes)
[Commentary:
Submit claim using an “A” prefix assessment when an assessment is rendered in conjunction
with a special visit premium. Information regarding when special visit premiums are payable is
found on pages GP65 to GP78 of the General Preamble.]
Independent Consideration (IC)
Services listed in the Schedule without specified fees are identified as “IC” and are given independent
consideration by the medical consultant. Claims for such services must be submitted with a
supporting letter explaining the amount of the fee claimed, and must include an appropriate operative
or consultation report, and a comparison of the scope and difficulty of the procedure in relation to non-
IC procedures in the Schedule. For treatment of tumours not listed in the Schedule, surgeons must
use the IC code, R993, and for surgical procedures not listed, but similar to a listed service, the code,
R990.

CONSTITUENT AND COMMON ELEMENTS OF INSURED SERVICES
[Commentary:
This Schedule identifies the constituent elements that comprise insured services. Common
elements apply to all insured services and specific elements apply to specific groups of
services where identified either in the General Preamble or in the preamble to a specific
system and/or specialty sections of the Schedule. There may be additional specific
requirements (“required elements of service”, “payment rules”, “claims submission instructions”
or “notes”) for some individual services, and these are noted with the description of any such
service within the Schedule. In order to determine the correct claim to use for a service
rendered, the necessary information is found by reviewing the common elements, specific
elements, and service specific information.
No charges may be made (except to OHIP) for an insured service rendered to an insured
person or for any of the constituent elements of such insured services. This is prohibited by the
Act and/or the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004.
Most services include as a constituent element of the service the provision of the premises,
equipment, supplies, and personnel used in the performance of the common and specific
elements of the service. This is not, however, the case for services denoted by codes marked
with the prefix “#”, and for services that are divided into professional and technical components
where only the professional component is an insured service under the Act.
For those codes denoted with the prefix “#” and performed in a hospital, the premises,
equipment, supplies, and personnel used to perform all elements of the service are funded by
the hospital global budget.
For those services denoted with the prefix “#” and provided in an Integrated Community Health
Services Centre (ICHSC), the premises, equipment, supplies, and personnel are funded under
the facility costs set out in the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.
Patients cannot be charged for the premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for services
denoted with the prefix “#” rendered outside of a hospital or ICHSC if the premises, equipment,
supplies and personnel support, assist or provide a necessary adjunct to an insured service
denoted with the prefix “#” as charging a patient would be contrary to the Integrated
Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.]
COMMON ELEMENTS OF INSURED SERVICES
All insured services include the skill, time, and responsibility involved in performing, including when
delegated to a non-physician in accordance with the Delegated Procedures Section (GP62) of the
General Preamble, supervising the performance of the constituent elements of the service.
Unless otherwise specifically listed in the Schedule, the following elements are common to all insured
services.
A. Being available to provide follow-up insured services to the patient and arranging for coverage
when not available.
B. Making arrangements for appointment(s) for the insured service.
C. Travelling to and from the place(s) where any element(s) of the service is (are) performed.
[Commentary:
Travelling to visit an insured person outside of the usual geographical area of practice of the
person making the visit is an uninsured service – see Regulation 552 section 24(1) paragraph
1 under the Act.]

SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF ASSESSMENTS
In addition to the common elements, all services which are described as assessments, or as including
assessments (e.g. consultations), include the following specific elements:
A. A direct physical encounter with the patient including taking a patient history and performing a
physical examination.
B. Other inquiry (including taking a patient history), carried out to arrive at an opinion as to the nature
of the patient’s condition, (whether such inquiry takes place before, during or after the encounter
during which the physical examination takes place) and/or follow-up care.
C. Performing any procedure(s) during the same encounter as the physical examination, unless the
procedure(s) is(are) separately listed in the Schedule and an amount is payable for the procedure
in conjunction with an assessment.
“Procedure” in this context includes obtaining specimens, preparation of the patient, interpretation
of results and, unless otherwise specified, all diagnostic (including laboratory) and therapeutic
(including surgical) services;
D. Making arrangements for any related assessments, procedures or therapy, and/or interpreting
results.
E. Making arrangements for follow-up care.
F. Discussion with, and providing advice and information, including prescribing therapy to the patient
or the patient’s representative, whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to:
1. the service; and
2. in circumstances in which it would be professionally appropriate that results can be reported
upon prior to any further patient visit, the results of related procedure(s) and/or assessment(s).
G. When medically indicated, monitoring the condition of the patient and intervening, until the next
insured service is provided.
H. Providing premises, equipment, supplies, and personnel for the specific elements of the service
except for any aspect(s) that is (are) performed in a hospital or nursing home.
While no occasion may arise for performing elements C, D, E, G, or H, when performed in connection
with the other specific elements, they are included in the assessment.

CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A consultation is an assessment rendered following a written request from a referring:
1. physician
2. nurse practitioner or
3. dental surgeon in connection with an insured dental procedure rendered in a hospital,
who, in light of his/her professional knowledge of the patient, requests the opinion of a physician (the
“consultant physician”) competent to give advice in this field because of the complexity, seriousness,
or obscurity of the case, or because another opinion is requested by the patient or patient’s
representative.
[Commentary:
1.The referring physician, nurse practitioner or dental surgeon must determine if multiple
requests by a patient or the patient’s representative to different physicians in the same
specialty for the same condition are medically necessary. Services that are not medically
necessary are uninsured.
2.If the physician rendering the service requests a referring physician, nurse practitioner or
dental surgeon to submit a consultation request for that service after the service has been
provided, a consultation is not payable. The visit fee appropriate to the service rendered may
be claimed.
3. Where a physician who has been paid for a consultation for the patient for the same
diagnosis makes a request for a referral for ongoing management of the patient, the service
rendered following the referral is not payable as a consultation, except as outlined in the
Virtual Care Services section under definitions, part 3, commentary 3]
A consultation includes the services necessary to enable the consultant to prepare a written report
(including findings, opinions, and recommendations) to the referring physician, nurse practitioner or
dental surgeon. Where the referral is made by a nurse practitioner, the consultant shall provide the
report to the nurse practitioner and the patient’s primary care provider, if applicable. Except where
otherwise specified, the consultant is required to perform a general, specific or medical specific
assessment, including a review of all relevant data.
The following are additional requirements for a consultation:
a. A copy of the written request for the consultation, signed by the referring physician, nurse
practitioner or dental surgeon must be kept in the consulting physician’s medical record,
except in the case of a consultation which occurs in a hospital, long-term care institution or
multi-specialty clinic where common medical records are maintained. In such cases, the
written request may be contained on the common medical record.
b. The request identifies the consultant by name, the referring physician, nurse practitioner or
dental surgeon by name and billing number, and identifies the patient by name and health
number.
c. The written request sets out the information relevant to the referral and specifies the
service(s) required.
In the event these requirements are not met, the amount payable for a consultation will be reduced to
a lesser assessment fee.

CONSULTATIONS
REPEAT CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A repeat consultation is an additional consultation rendered by the same consultant, in respect of the
same presenting problem, following care rendered to the patient by another physician in the interval
following the initial consultation but preceding the repeat consultation.
A repeat consultation has the same requirements as a consultation including the requirement for a
new written request by the referring physician, nurse practitioner or dental surgeon.
LIMITED CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A limited consultation is a consultation which is less demanding and, in terms of time, normally
requires substantially less of the physician’s time than the full consultation. Otherwise, a limited
consultation has the same requirements as a full consultation.
Under the heading of “Family Practice & Practice in General", a limited consultation is the service
rendered by any physician who is not a specialist, where the service meets all the requirements for a
consultation but, because of the nature of the referral, only those services which constitute a specific
assessment are rendered.
EMERGENCY ROOM (ER) PHYSICIAN CONSULTATION
Payment rules:
1. The amount payable for a consultation by an ER Physician will be adjusted to a lesser
assessment fee under either of the following circumstances:
a. the patient is referred by another ER physician in the same hospital; or
b. the service is rendered in any location other than the emergency department or other critical
care area in a hospital, or to a critically ill patient in a hospital.
2. ER reports constitute adequate documentation of the written report of the consultation as long
as the rendering of all constituent elements is clearly documented on all copies of the report. If
the consulting physician fails to ensure that a copy of the ER report is sent to the physician or
nurse practitioner who referred the patient, the amount payable for the service will be adjusted
to the amount payable for an assessment.
Claims submission instruction:
Claims for ER Physician consultations are to be submitted using H055 for a specialist in emergency
medicine (FRCP) and H065 for all other physicians.
SPECIAL SURGICAL CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A special surgical consultation is rendered when a surgeon provides all the appropriate elements of a
regular consultation and is required to devote at least fifty minutes exclusively to the consultation with
the patient.
[Commentary:
The calculation of the 50 minute minimum excludes time devoted to any other service or
procedure for which an amount is payable in addition to the consultation.]

E-Assessments
Definition/Required elements of service:
An e-assessment is a service performed by a specialist when a primary care physician or nurse
practitioner requests an opinion and/or recommendations from the specialist for management of a
specific patient by providing information electronically through a secure server (e.g. secure
messaging, EMR). The specialist is required to review all relevant data provided by the primary care
physician or nurse practitioner, including the review of any additional information that may be
submitted subsequent to the initial request. For the purpose of this service, “relevant data” may
include family/patient history, history of the presenting complaint, laboratory and diagnostic tests, and
visual images where indicated.
In addition to the Common Elements, E-assessments include the specific elements of assessments,
as listed in the General Preamble, except for paragraphs A and B.
Payment rules:
1.E-assessments are only eligible for payment if the specialist has provided an opinion and/or
recommendations for patient management to the primary care physician or nurse practitioner
within 30 days from the date of the request. Where a service is requested by a nurse
practitioner the consultant shall provide the report to the nurse practitioner and the patient’s
primary care provider, if applicable.
2.E-assessments are not eligible for payment to the specialist in the following circumstances
a.when the purpose of the electronic communication is to arrange for transfer of the
patient’s care to any physician; or
b.when rendered in whole or in part to arrange for a consultation, a different assessment,
visit, or K-prefix time-based services, procedure(s), or diagnostic investigation(s); or
c.when the specialist renders a K-prefix time-based service for the same patient within 30
days following the request for the specialist e-assessment; or
d.in circumstances where the primary care physician or specialist receives compensation,
other than by fee-for service under this Schedule, for participation in the e-assessment.
3.A consultation, a different assessment or visit rendered by the specialist for the same patient
for the same diagnosis within 60 days following the request for the specialist e-assessment is
only payable as a specific or partial assessment, as appropriate to the service rendered.
4.K738 is eligible for payment to the primary care physician when this physician is required to
collect additional data (for example dermatology or ophthalmology images not present in the
primary care physician’s records) to support the specialist’s e-assessment. K738 is not
eligible for payment where existing data is already available in the primary care physician’s
records for submission to the specialist.
[Commentary:
1.Following the primary care physician’s request, the specialist decides whether an e-

the primary care physician or nurse practitioner for a specific patient and diagnosis where the
specialist must review all relevant data provided by the primary care physician and provide a written
opinion that includes a diagnosis and/or management advice to the primary care physician or nurse
practitioner.
[Commentary:
The time and intensity of this service is the same as a regular consultation. The specialist may
choose to return their opinion by phone, however, a written opinion must be provided
electronically or by mail.]
Payment rules:
Initial e-assessments are limited to a maximum of one per patient per specialist per 12 month
period unless the primary care physician or nurse practitioner makes a second request in
relation to a complaint for which a clearly different diagnosis is made, unrelated to the
diagnosis made at the time of the first e-assessment in that same 12 month period, in which
case the limit is increased to a maximum of two per patient per specialist per 12 month period.
[Commentary:
If a subsequent e-assessment is related to the diagnosis made at the time of the initial e-
assessment, then this service is payable as a repeat e-assessment, follow-up e-assessment or

A minor e-assessment is where the primary care physician or nurse practitioner may ask a
specific question related to the patient where the information provided is limited and the
question asked is very specific. An example is where the primary care physician has initiated a
treatment recommended by the specialist, and the primary care physician requests a brief
email response related to proper dosing adjustments. One service may include multiple emails.

A. Admission Assessment – General Requirements
Definition:
a. An admission assessment is the initial assessment of the patient rendered for the purpose
of admitting a patient to hospital.
b. The admitting physician is the physician who renders the admission assessment.
Payment rules:
1. Except as outlined below in paragraph 3, when the admitting physician has not previously
assessed the patient for the same presenting illness within 90 days of the admission
assessment, the admission assessment constitutes a consultation, general or medical specific
or specific assessment depending on the specialty of the physician, the nature of the service
rendered and any applicable payment rules.
2. Except as outlined below in paragraph 3, if the admitting physician has previously assessed the
patient for the same presenting illness within 90 days of the admission assessment, the
admission assessment constitutes a general re-assessment or specific re-assessment
depending on the specialty of the physician, the nature of the service rendered and any
applicable payment rules.
3. When a hospital in-patient is transferred from one physician to another physician, only one
consultation, general or specific assessment or reassessment is eligible for payment
per patient admission. The amount eligible for payment for services in excess of this limit will be
adjusted to a lesser assessment fee. An additional admission assessment is not eligible for
payment when a hospital inpatient is transferred from one physician to another physician within
the same hospital.
Admission Assessments by Specialists:
When a patient has been assessed by a specialist in the emergency room (ER) or out-patient
department (OPD) and that physician renders a service described as a consultation, specific
assessment, or medical specific assessment and subsequently admits the patient to hospital, the
initial consultation, specific, or medical specific assessment constitutes the admission assessment.
When a patient has been assessed by a specialist in the ER or OPD, and that physician renders any
other assessment other than those listed in the paragraph immediately above, and that physician
subsequently admits the patient to hospital, an admission assessment is eligible for payment in
addition to the initial assessment, if each service is rendered separately.
[Commentary:
In accordance with the surgical preamble, a hospital admission assessment by the surgeon is
not eligible for payment, unless it is the “major pre-operative visit” (i.e., the consultation or
assessment which may be claimed when the decision to operate is made and the operation is
scheduled).]

B. Subsequent Visit
Definition:
A subsequent visit is any routine assessment in hospital following the hospital admission assessment.
Attendance at Surgery: If, in the interest of the patient, the referring physician is asked to be
present by the patient or the patient’s representative, but does not assist at the procedure, the
attendance at surgery by the referring physician constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.
Multidisciplinary care: Except where a single service for a team of physicians is listed in this
Schedule (e.g. the weekly team fee for dialysis), when the complexity of the medical condition
requires the services of several physicians in different disciplines, each physician visit
constitutes a subsequent visit.
Payment rules:
1. Except in the circumstances outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3, or when a patient is referred from
one physician to another (see Claims submission instruction below), subsequent visits are
limited to one per patient, per day for the first 5 weeks after admission, 3 visits per week from 6
to 13 weeks after admission, and 6 visits per month after 13 weeks. Services in excess of the
limit are not eligible for payment.
2. After 5 weeks of hospitalization, any assessment in hospital required as a result of an acute
intercurrent illness in excess of the weekly or monthly limits set out above constitutes C121 –
“additional visit due to intercurrent illness”. The weekly or monthly limits set out above do not
apply to additional visits due to intercurrent illness.
3. Pediatric subsequent visits (C262) are limited to one per patient, per day for the duration of the
admission.
4. When a physician is already in the hospital and assesses one of his/her own patients or patients
transferred to his/her care, the service constitutes a subsequent visit. If a physician assesses
another physician’s patient on an emergency basis, the General Listings (“A” prefix) apply.
Claims submission instruction:
When a hospital in-patient is referred from one physician to another physician, the date the second
physician assessed the patient for the first time is considered the “admission date” for the purposes of
determining the appropriate subsequent visit fee code.
[Commentary:
When a hospital in-patient is transferred from one physician to another physician, subsequent
visits by the second physician are calculated based on the actual admission date of the
patient.]

one of the following circumstances ("the eligible times"):
1. if the insured service is commenced evenings (17:00 hr-24:00 hr) Monday to Friday; daytime or
evenings on Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays; or nights (24:00 hr-07:00 hr);
2. if rendered requiring sacrifice of office hours; or
3. if rendered during daytime hours (07:00 - 17:00 hrs Monday through Friday) in circumstances in
which a travel premium is eligible for payment.
C. Additional person premium
An additional person premium is only eligible for payment for services rendered at the destination to
additional patients seen in emergency departments, outpatient departments, long-term care
institutions or to hospital inpatients, provided that each additional patient service is commenced
during the eligible times.
[Commentary:
Special visit premiums are not eligible for payment for elective services rendered at a long-term
care institution, including a nursing home or home for the aged, even when the long-term care
institution is the "home" of the patient.
Submit claims for routine elective visits in these locations as subsequent visits. For example, if
the physician is called to a nursing home to see a patient for a non-elective problem at 8AM,
and subsequently sees his/her routine patients on rounds, those additional patients do not
qualify for the additional person premium.]

1.A physician who supervises a medical trainee who renders an insured service is eligible to
be paid for the insured service as if the supervising physician performed the service
personally, subject to any terms, conditions and limitations found in this section.
2.The sole purpose of the terms and conditions described in this section is to define when a
service is payable by OHIP. These terms and conditions do not alter the College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario Professional Responsibilities in Postgraduate Medical
Education requirements or any requirements of the institutions responsible for postgraduate
medical education.]
Note:
Unless otherwise specified in this section, all other payment requirements in the Schedule
related to any service that is performed by a Medical Trainee are applicable.
DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this section of the Schedule only, the following Definitions apply:

responsibility to guide, observe and assess the educational activities of
the Medical Trainee and assures the quality of an insured service while
being rendered by the Medical Trainee.
Supervision is only performed:
a. in person, by telephone, or videoconference, the method being consistent with the acuity of
the service being rendered by the Medical Trainee as well as the Medical Trainee’s level of
competence;
b. when the service is provided within a setting approved by the educational institution where
the Medical Trainee is registered; and
c. when the service is within the scope and oversight of the postgraduate medical training
program in which the Medical Trainee is registered.
[Commentary:
The Supervising Physician and the Medical Trainee must be physically present in Ontario.]
Supervising The Supervising Physician is a physician who performs Supervision of a
Physician Medical Trainee who renders an insured service to an insured person.

SUPERVISION OF POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL TRAINEES
Payment Rules
A. GENERAL
1. A service rendered by a Medical Trainee is only eligible for payment to the Supervising
Physician where Supervision is provided as defined above and subject to the specific
requirements below.
2. Where a Resident with an OHIP billing number is providing insured services independently and
outside their training program, the insured service is not eligible for payment to a Supervising
Physician as there is no Supervision provided.
[Commentary:
In the scenario described above the Resident is not performing the service as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Resident would bill OHIP for the service provided.]
3. Where a Clinical Fellow with an OHIP billing number is providing insured services
independently and outside their training program, the insured service is not eligible for payment
to a Supervising Physician as there is no Supervision provided.
[Commentary:
In the scenario described above the Clinical Fellow is not performing the services as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Clinical Fellow would bill OHIP for the services provided. For

CANCELLED SURGERY - ANAESTHESIA SERVICES
Payment rules:
1. If an anaesthesiologist examines a patient prior to surgery and the surgery is cancelled prior to
the induction of anaesthesia, the service rendered constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.
2. When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled prior to commencement of
surgery, the service constitutes E006C with the actual number of time units added to 6 basic
units for this service.
[Commentary:
If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced, the amount payable is calculated by
adding the listed procedural basic units plus time units and multiplying the total by the unit fee.]
SECOND ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
Unless otherwise specified in the Schedule, when the anaesthetic services of more than one
anaesthesiologist are necessary in the interest of the patient, the service provided by the second
anaesthesiologist constitutes E001C with the actual number of time units (based on the actual time
assisting the first anaesthesiologist) added to 6 basic units.
REPLACEMENT ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
When one anaesthesiologist starts a procedure and is replaced by another anaesthesiologist (“the
replacement anaesthesiologist”) during a surgical procedure or delivery:
a. the amount payable to the first anaesthesiologist is calculated by adding the listed
procedural basic units plus time units for the time the first anaesthesiologist is in attendance;
b. except in the case of continuous conduction anaesthesia, the service provided by the
replacement anaesthesiologist constitutes E005C based on the actual number of time units
and 6 basic units.
Note:
E005C qualifies for the premiums E400C or E401C only if the case commences after hours
(see GP94).
[Commentary:
1.Each anaesthesiologist must indicate, as part of the medical record, his/her starting and

Note:
For the purposes of anaesthesia services the following definitions apply:
1.Procedural Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients
respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile
stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous
ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
2.Deep Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot
be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. The
ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require
assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate.
Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
3.General Anaesthesia is a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not
arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory
function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway,
and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous
ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function
may be impaired.
ANAESTHESIA ADMINISTERED BY SAME PHYSICIAN PERFORMING A PROCEDURE
1. Except as described in paragraph 2, when a physician administers an anaesthetic, nerve block
and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in conjunction with a
diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs on the same patient,
the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication is not eligible for
payment.

VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this section of the Schedule only, the following Definitions apply:
Comprehensive Virtual Care Service means a Virtual Care Service rendered where an
Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship exists, and in the physicians’ professional
opinion in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice, the person's care
and support requirements can be effectively and appropriately delivered by Video or
Telephone.
Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship means:
1. Where a physician is providing a Virtual Care Service to a patient where there has been at least
one insured service with a direct physical encounter between the patient and that physician
(Family and General Practice Physician or specialist) in the preceding 24-months; or
2. Where a physician is providing a Virtual Care Service to a patient who has signed the MOH’s
Patient Enrollment and Consent to Release Personal Health Information form and is enrolled to
that physician or another physician within the same group (who is signatory/locum to a MOH
alternate funding plan agreement); or
3. Where a specialist or GP Focused Practice Physician is providing a consultation by Video set
out in Appendix J – Section 1, or has provided any such consultation in the preceding 24-
months to that patient; or
[Commentary:
Where the visit leading to the referral for consultation has occurred virtually, it would be
expected that the referring physician has an established relationship with the patient and that
the clinical issue leading to the referral has been assessed in-person within the previous 12-
months.]
[Commentary:
A consultation billed as an insured service under K083 or as an uninsured service funded
under the Ontario Virtual Care Program and rendered prior to December 1, 2022, is considered
evidence of an Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship.]
[Commentary:
Where a physician who has been paid for a consultation for the patient for the same diagnosis
makes a request for a referral for ongoing management of the patient, the service rendered
following the referral is not payable as a consultation, unless the request for referral, if the
referral is made, allows for an ongoing patient physician relationship in the context of a
consultation by Video.]
4. Where a physician provides any of the following services, or has provided any of the following
services in the preceding 24-months:
• A920 – Medical management of early pregnancy - initial service by Video or
Telephone,
• A945/C945 – Special palliative care consultation by Video,
• A680/C680 – Initial assessment - substance abuse by Video,

2.A special palliative care consultation billed as an insured service under K092/K093 and
rendered prior to December 1, 2022, is considered evidence of an Existing/Ongoing Patient-
Physician Relationship.]
GP Focused Practice Physician means, for the purpose of eligibility to provide a focused
practice consultation by Video (A010, A011, A906, A913, A914), a physician who has been
designated by the bi-lateral MOH-OMA GP Focused Practice Review Committee or a physician
who is eligible for the focused practice psychotherapy premium.
Limited Virtual Care Service means a Virtual Care Service rendered where an Existing/
Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship does not exist, and in the physicians’ professional
opinion in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice, the person's care
and support requirements can be effectively and appropriately delivered by Video or
Telephone.

Verified-Virtual Visit Solution;
Terms and Conditions for Virtual Care Services
1. Other than a direct physical encounter, all other requirements and conditions for the appropriate
service as described in the Schedule must be met.
2. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment where it is not medically appropriate to
provide the specific service without a direct physical encounter.
a. If during the course of a Virtual Care Service it becomes apparent that the service cannot be
appropriately completed without a direct physical encounter, the Virtual Care Service is not
eligible for payment (only the service with a direct physical encounter is eligible for
payment).

VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
b. Where a patient requests a virtual visit (is not willing to present in-person, despite the
physician’s advice and availability), physicians may submit a claim for the appropriate fee
code for the service that was rendered virtually.
3. Video services are only eligible for payment when performed using a Verified Virtual Visit
Solution.
[Commentary:
Ontario Health’s public list of verified solutions is available at: https://www.ontariohealth.ca/our-
work/digital-standards/virtual-visits-verification-standard/vendor-list.]
4. All other insured services that are rendered by Video or Telephone to insured persons and that
are not Comprehensive Virtual Care Services, Limited Virtual Care Services, or specifically
listed as insured services or are a component of an insured service are not eligible for payment.
5. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless the delivery modality is documented on
the patient's medical record.
6. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless initiated by the patient or the patient’s
representative, or the service represents a medically necessary follow-up visit to a preceding
visit initiated by the patient or the patient’s representative.
[Commentary:
As per GP15, following an insured service, discussion with, and providing advice and
information, including prescribing therapy to the patient or the patient’s representative, whether
by Telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service is a specific element of the
preceding service and should not be separately claimed. This includes reporting results of
related procedures and/or assessments (when professionally appropriate to report without
additional patient assessment) and monitoring the patient’s condition remotely until the next
medically necessary assessment.
For clarity, administrative staff may co-ordinate appointments and organize care in a manner
analogous to in-person encounters without violating this condition. Similarly, medically
necessary follow-up services may be organized by the provider (or by their staff) without
violating the condition. However, a physician-initiated call to “check-in” on a patient would not
be eligible for payment, nor would any telephone calls or Video encounters conducted for
administrative purposes (such as to inform patients of clinic closures or the availability of
remote services).
Furthermore, services are not eligible for payment when initiated by the physician (or the
physician’s staff) without a clear and medically necessary reason for doing so. For example,
the communication of normal lab work, unless medically necessary (in so far as the clinical
management of the patient is altered) should not be billed.
Physician-initiated communication to provide advice or guidance regarding a previously
rendered service is also not separately eligible/ billable. A common example of this would occur
when a patient is provided with a prescription along with instruction to fill it only upon receipt of
a positive test result. The call to inform the patient of the test result is not eligible for payment
as it would be considered a Specific Element of the initial (refer to: item F, GP15, Schedule of
Benefits).

--- PAGE 193 ---
CONSULTATIONS AND VISITS
VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
As a general rule, the provider should consider whether the remote encounter would have
occurred in their “in-person” practice. In circumstances where an in-person encounter would
not have taken place, it is unlikely that a claim for a virtual service could be supported.
Consultations, which arise from requests from other providers, would not violate the condition
in so far as the patient would have assented to the referral as part of their discussion with the
referring provider.]
7. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless personally performed by the physician
or rendered in accordance with the payment rules regarding supervision of a Medical Trainee.
8. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment for services provided to hospital inpatients or
patients in a Long-Term Care institution unless all of the following requirements have been met:
• The physician providing the service is not the patient's MRP.
• The hospital/Long-Term Care institution does not have a physician on staff and
present in the community with the expertise to render the necessary service, as
documented by the referring physician in the patient’s medical record.
• An assessment with a direct physical encounter by the referring physician must
have been completed within 30 days preceding a virtual in-patient specialist
consultation to confirm the need for a consultation.
9. Services involving a direct physical encounter must be made available by the physician
providing Comprehensive Virtual Care Services, or by the physician’s group, within a clinically
appropriate time-frame, if it becomes apparent during a Virtual Care Service that a service
involving a direct physical encounter is medically necessary, or if at the time of scheduling the
service the patient expresses preference for a service involving a direct physical encounter.
[Commentary:
For the purpose of this provision, with respect to specialist and GP Focused Practice
Physicians, a group is defined as: those physicians in the same hospital specialty call rotation,
or who are co-located in shared clinical physical space, and have shared access to the
patient’s medical record. For family and general practice physicians, a group is defined as:
Patient Enrollment Model physicians who are signatory or contracted to the same specific
group contract (i.e., as identified by the same group billing number), or those physicians who
are co-located in a shared clinical physical space and have shared access to the patient’s
medical record].
10.If during the course of a Virtual Care Service the modality changes (for example, a Telephone
service transitions into a Video service), only the service performed by the modality that
represents the greater part (more than 50%) of the time spent providing the Virtual Care Service
is payable. For time-based services, the combined time of both modalities will be used to
calculate the number of time units eligible for payment.
11. For time-based services, only time spent in direct communication with the patient or the
patient’s representative in the provision of the insured service will be used to calculate the
number of time units eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
Both the patient and physician must be located in Ontario for the services to be insured and
payable under OHIP (see section 37.1 of Regulation 552 under the HIA).]

Payment rules:
1.The routine pre-anaesthetic evaluation of the patient required by Reg 965 of the Public
Hospitals Act does not constitute a consultation, regardless of where and when this
evaluation is performed.
2.For A210 the start and stop time of the service must be recorded in the patient’s permanent

[Commentary:
1.The general anaesthesia service includes a pre-anaesthetic evaluation, with specific
elements as for assessments (see GP15) which does not constitute a consultation
2.P014C - is an anaesthesia service, therefore the pre-anaesthetic evaluation is included in the
service and is not payable as a limited consultation for acute pain management or as any
other consultation or assessment.]

SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Nuclear Medicine procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the columns headed
with a "P", and a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H". The technical
component of the procedure subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
In addition to the common elements, the components of Nuclear Medicine procedures include the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is(are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
Note:
1.Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
2.If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B
and C, these may be delegated to another physician.
3.Where the only component provided is interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure,
the specific elements A and C listed for the professional component are included in the
specific elements of the technical component.
For Technical Component H
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure(s).
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s representative,
whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretive report of the procedure to the
referring provider.
G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect(s) of A and D of the
professional component that is(are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is
performed.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for the technical
component H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional
component are submitted using listed fee code with suffix C. (e.g. J802C)
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health
Insurance Act are listed under P (use suffix C). Costs for the technical component of these
services are only billable under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.
3. With the exception of J818, J835, J821, J834, J880 or when SPECT is claimed, if quantification
or data manipulation is carried out in addition to visual inspection of imaging studies, add 30%
to the appropriate professional benefit. For claim purposes, use prefix “Y”. Such activity must
add significant diagnostic information not available by inspection alone and does not include
simple image enhancement techniques such as smoothing, background subtraction, etc.
Recording of images on videotape for replay and production of images on the video display of a
computer do not in themselves justify the additional benefit. The claims for cardiac wall motion
studies and calculation of ventricular ejection fraction (J811 and J813) already include an
allowance for data manipulation as a general rule and no additional benefit may be claimed.
The additional computer benefit may be claimed only when additional cardiac quantifications
are performed i.e. stroke volume ratio and volume response curves and/or phase analysis.
4. If examination of Brain, Lung, Liver or Spleen is limited to one view, the benefit (H and P) is to
be reduced by 50%.
5. Repeat studies on the same day may be claimed only after exercise or drug intervention.
6. When tomographic examination (SPECT) is billed, the 30% add-on referred to in paragraph 3
may not be claimed.
7. Costs for the technical component of services rendered in an ICHSC are listed in the Schedule
of Facility Costs.
8. The technical and professional fee components for myocardial perfusion imaging /
echocardiogram/exercise stress test/stress echocardiogram are not eligible for payment in the
routine preoperative preparation or screening of a patient for surgery where the patient will
undergo a low risk procedure or has a low risk of perioperative cardiac complications, unless
there is a clinical indication requiring myocardial perfusion imaging/exercise stress test/cardiac
stress echo studies other than solely for preoperative preparation of the patient.
[Commentary:
1.Studies have indicated that for non cardiac surgery, there may be no clinical benefit and
there may be harm in performing functional cardiac testing in patients with low operative risk
and little or limited benefit in moderate risk patients. BMJ 2010, Jan 28; 340.
2.One example of a generally accepted guideline is the American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines that states:
a.Non invasive testing could be considered in patients with 1 to 2 risk factors and poor
functional capacity (less than 4 mets) who require intermediate risk surgery if it will
change management (class IIb)
b.Non invasive testing has not been show to be useful in patients with no clinical risk factors
undergoing intermediate risk non cardiac surgery (class III).
c.Non invasive testing has not been shown to useful in patients undergoing low risk non
cardiac surgery (class III)]

component of the procedures subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospital Act.
[Commentary:
As described in Regulation 552 of the Health Insurance Act, for a service to be insured, the
interpreting physician must physically be present in Ontario when the interpretation service is
rendered.]
In addition to the common elements, the components of Diagnostic Radiology procedures include the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component P
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate, and quality control of all elements of the technical component
of the procedure.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable (e.g. injections which are an integral part of the study) and of any fluoroscopy.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is (are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B and C,
these may be delegated to another physician who must personally perform the service. Element D
must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
For Technical Component H
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure or assisting in the performance of fluoroscopy.
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s
representative, whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretive report of the procedure to the
referring provider.
G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect(s) of A and D of the
professional component that is (are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is
performed.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
PREAMBLE
OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for technical component
H are submitted using the listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional component P are
submitted using the listed fee code with suffix C.
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health
Insurance Act are listed under the column P (use suffix C). Costs for the technical component of
these services are only claimed under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act,
2023. Costs for the technical component of services rendered in an ICHSC are listed in the
Schedule of Facility Costs.
3. Benefits for clinical procedures related to x-ray examinations are listed in the following section,
or under Diagnostic and Therapeutic or Surgical Procedures. ‘Clinical Procedures’, in this
context, are those by which contrast media are introduced, except oral or rectal administration
for study of the alimentary tract, and intravenous injections, which are an integral part of the
study, performed by the physician collecting the benefit for the procedure.
4. If less than the minimum number of views are performed, reduce listed fees by 25%.
5. If insured diagnostic radiology procedures yield abnormal findings or if they would yield
information which in the opinion of the radiologist would be insufficient governed by the needs of
the patient and the requirements of the referring provider or practitioner, the radiologist may add
further views and claim for them (if listed).
6. All benefits listed apply to unilateral examinations unless otherwise specified. When a
radiologist is asked to x-ray one extremity only, no additional claim should be made for
comparison x-rays initiated by the radiologist.
7. A stereo pair is to be counted as two views.
8. No additional claim is warranted for the use of the image intensifier in diagnostic radiology.
9. Complex head CT scans are meant to be multiplanar (multidirectional) head CT scans - to
include one or more of the following areas: pituitary fossa, posterior fossa, internal auditory
meati, orbits and related structures, the temporal bone and its contents and the
temporomandibular joints. X400, X401 and X188 are not to be billed in addition to those fees for
complex head studies.
10.Nasal bones or accessory nasal sinuses should not be routinely claimed in skull examination
requests.
11. Mandible X006 and Temporomandibular joints X007 are not both to be routinely claimed on the
same patient but only when specifically ordered.
12.Conventional films of the spine should not be routinely done and claimed for before
myelography. The necessity of having plain film studies of the spine prior to interpreting the
myelographic studies is obvious. It is not essential, however, that these be done at the
institution where the myelogram was done. If they have been done at an outside office, then it is
a matter for the radiologist and the referring provider to have the films available. If they cannot
be made available to the radiologist, it is an acceptable practice for him to do the required
procedure of these areas and to claim for them so that they may be available for interpretation
along with the myelographic study.
13.Lumbar or lumbosacral spine X028 does not include the entire sacrum. An x-ray of the sacrum
may be carried out and claimed for only when specifically indicated.

14.Three or more views of the chest should not be done routinely and claimed when a chest
examination is requested.
15.Chest studies should not be routinely done and claimed in mammography cases.
16.Fluoroscopy claims should not be submitted for any examination performed by the radiologist
where fluoroscopy is generally regarded as an integral part of the examinations e.g.
examinations of the GI tract, urinary tract, and special procedures.
17.‘Colon - air contrast’ may be claimed when performed according to generally accepted criteria.
The colon should be scrupulously prepared. Five to eight full size views of the abdomen should
be obtained after fluoroscopically controlled introduction of air and barium.
18.‘Oesophagus, stomach and duodenum - double contrast’ presupposes the introduction of gas,
the use of antifoam agent and a suitable barium mixture.
19.'Pharynx and oesophagus - cine or videotape' (X106) should not be claimed routinely with X108
and X109 but only when specifically indicated.
20.Abdomen and chest studies should not be routinely done and claimed in gastrointestinal
examinations.
21.Abdomen and/or pelvis should not be routinely claimed in lumbar spine examination requests.
22.A survey film of the abdomen is a single view. The ordering of additional films should be left to
the discretion of the radiologist who should have the power to determine what examination is
adequate for a specific patient. Obviously, if progress of a long tube is being followed, a survey
film is sufficient. If, however, an intestinal obstruction is being followed, a single film is usually
inadequate.
23.No extra fee should be claimed for rapid sequence IVP.
24.Nephrotomography is covered by the listings for intravenous pyelogram and planigram.
25.Preoperative and Routine Chest X-rays
a. The technical and professional fee components for chest x-ray, X090, X091 and X092 are
not eligible for payment in the routine preoperative preparation or screening of a patient for
non-cardiac, non-thoracic surgery, unless there is a clinical indication requiring a chest x-ray
other than solely for preoperative preparation or screening of the patient.
[Commentary:
Examples of indications could include but are not limited to:
1.suspected active airway or airspace disease
2.workup of shortness of breath
3.metastatic workup]
b. The technical and professional fee components for chest x-ray, X090, X091 and X092 are
only eligible for payment when rendered for a patient who has symptoms, signs or an
indication supported by current clinical practice guidelines relevant to the individual patient’s
circumstances.
[Commentary:
Routine chest x-rays for screening or for admission to hospital without clinical indication are not
payable.]
26.X-ray or CT studies of the lumbar spine should not be routinely ordered or rendered for low back
pain without suspected or known pathology.

BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD) MEASUREMENT
H P
Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) - by axial technique only
Definition:
For the purpose of second and subsequent testing,
“high risk patient” means a patient:
1.at risk for accelerated bone loss (in the absence of other risk factors, patient age is deemed
not to place a patient at high risk for accelerated bone loss);
2.with osteopenia or osteoporosis on any previous BMD testing; or
3.with bone loss in excess of 1% per year as demonstrated by previous BMD testing.
“low risk patient” means a patient who is not a high risk patient.
Definition/Required elements of service:
BMD measurement by DXA is an insured service only when all the following conditions have
been met:
1.the service is rendered for the prevention and management of osteoporosis or osteopenia;
2.when more than one site is measured, the sites include both hip and spine and where
measurement of both hip and spine is not technically feasible the site measured consists of
either hip or spine.
[Commentary:
Measurement of hip and spine would be considered not technically feasible due to prosthesis
or deformity.]

4.Any combination of services described by X152 or X153 that were rendered to a patient
between July 1, 2007 and April 1, 2008 for which claims were submitted and paid as insured
services under the Health Insurance Act constitutes, a “second test – low risk patient” for the
purpose of determining service maximums for a second or subsequent test - low risk patient,
and is deemed to have been rendered on July 1, 2010.
5.Any service described by X152 or X153 rendered between April 1, 2008 and July 1, 2010 for
which a claim was submitted and paid as an insured service under the Health Insurance Act
constitutes a subsequent test - low risk patient for the purpose of determining service
maximums for second or subsequent test – low risk patient and is deemed to have been
rendered on July 1, 2010.
6.Subsequent test - high risk patients (X149/X155) is limited to a maximum of one test every 12
months unless the ordering physician obtains written prior authorization from a medical
consultant.
[Commentary:
Authorization will be dependent on the ordering physician demonstrating that the test is
generally accepted as necessary for the patient under the circumstances.]
[Commentary:
1.Baseline, second test and subsequent tests should be ordered only in accordance with
current practice guidelines. In those situations where testing is ordered on a particular patient
for reasons that vary from the guidelines, the ordering physician should ensure that the
patient’s medical record sufficiently explains the justification for the test in this particular
case.
2.In the event a patient with a previous normal baseline test (X145/X146) or second test (X152/
X153) or normal subsequent test – low risk patient (X142/X148) meets any of the criteria
listed for high risk patients as stated above, the patient would be eligible for subsequent test
– high risk patient services (X149/X155) subject to the restriction stated in payment rule #6.

4.Individuals under age 65 without one major or two minor risk factors typically do not benefit
from BMD measurement.]

For example, when a CT perfusion study is only performed in conjunction with a non-contrast
CT head scan, the appropriate claim is E874 and the non-contrast CT head service (e.g. X400,

SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Diagnostic Ultrasound procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the columns
headed with a “P”, and a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H". The technical
component of the procedures subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
In addition to the common elements, the components of Diagnostic Ultrasound procedures include the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect of D that is performed at a place other than the place in which
the procedure is performed.
Note:
1.Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
2.If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B
and C, these may be delegated to another physician.
3.Where the only component provided is interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure,
the specific elements A and C listed for the professional component are included in the
specific elements of the technical component.
For Technical Component H
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure(s).
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s representative,
whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretative report of the procedure to the
referring provider.
G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect of D of the professional
component that is(are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is performed.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for the technical
component H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional
component are submitted using listed fee code with suffix C. (e.g. J102C)
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health
Insurance Act are listed under the column P (use suffix C). Costs for the technical component of
these services are only billable under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act,
2023 and are listed in the Schedule of Facility Costs.
3. A-Mode - implies a one-dimensional ultrasonic measurement procedure.
4. M-Mode - implies a one-dimensional ultrasonic measurement procedure with movement of the
trace to record amplitude and velocity of moving echo-producing structures.
5. Scan B-Mode - implies a two-dimensional ultrasonic scanning procedure with a two-dimensional
display. All ultrasound examinations include a permanent record and interpretative report.
6. If insured diagnostic ultrasound procedures yield abnormal findings or if they would yield
information which in the opinion of the interpreting physician would be insufficient governed by
the needs of the patient and the requirements of the referring provider or practitioner, the
interpreting physician may add further views and claim for them (if listed).
7. All benefits listed apply to unilateral examinations unless otherwise specified. When imaging of
only one anatomical area is requested, comparison ultrasound(s) initiated by the interpreting
physician or facility are not eligible for payment.

[Commentary:
An example of a generally accepted methodology for determining 10 year risk of coronary
heart disease is the Framingham Risk Score.
1.Studies have indicated that for non cardiac surgery, there may be no clinical benefit and
there may be harm in performing functional cardiac testing in patients with low operative risk
and little or limited benefit in moderate risk patients. BMJ 2010, Jan 28; 340.
2.One example of a generally accepted guideline is the American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines that states:
a.Non invasive testing could be considered in patients with 1 to 2 risk factors and poor
functional capacity (less than 4 mets) who require intermediate risk surgery if it will
change management (class IIb)
b.Non invasive testing has not been show to be useful in patients with no clinical risk factors
undergoing intermediate risk non cardiac surgery (class III).
c.Non invasive testing has not been shown to useful in patients undergoing low risk non
cardiac surgery (class III).]

Life threatening critical care and other critical care
The duration of "life threatening critical care" and "other critical care" services that physicians
should document is the time they actually spend evaluating, managing, and providing care to
the critically ill or injured patient to the exclusion of all other work.
For example, time spent reviewing laboratory test results or discussing the critically ill patient's
care with other medical staff in the unit or at the nursing station on the floor would be included
in the definition of critical care, even when it does not occur at the bedside, if this time
represents their full attention to the management of the critically ill/injured patient.
Time spent involved in activities in any location other than the bedside, emergency department
or hospital floor where the patient is located cannot be claimed as the physician is not
immediately available to the patient.
Submit claims manually when the total time spent in providing "life threatening critical care" or
"other critical care" is greater than two (2) hours.]

CRITICAL CARE PER DIEM LISTINGS
A. The fees under physician-in-charge (the physician(s) daily providing the critical care services)
apply per patient treated, i.e. while the physician-in-charge may change during the course of
treatment, the daily fee formula as set out should be claimed by the physicians involved as if there
was only one physician-in-charge during the treatment program; in this sense, the daily fees are
team fees.
B. When claiming Critical, Ventilatory, Neonatal Intensive Care or Comprehensive Care fees no other
Critical Care codes may be paid to the same physician(s).
C. Other physicians other than those providing Critical Care or Comprehensive Care may claim the
appropriate consultation, visit and procedure fees not listed in the fee schedule for Critical Care.
These claims will be adjudicated by the Medical Consultant in an Independent Consideration basis.
D. If Ventilatory Support only is provided, for example, by the anaesthetist(s), claims should then be
made under Ventilatory Support. Comprehensive Care and Neonatal Intensive Care fees do not
apply.
E. Other physicians should then claim Critical Care fees or the appropriate consultation, visit or
procedures.
F. If the patient has been discharged from the Unit more than 48 hours and is re-admitted to the Unit,
the 1st day rate applies again on the day of re-admission.
G. The appropriate consultation, assessment and procedural benefits apply after stopping Critical
Care, Ventilatory Support, Comprehensive Care or Neonatal Intensive Care.
H. Unless otherwise stated, the Critical Care per diem fees should not be claimed for stabilized
patients and those patients who are in an intensive care unit for the purposes of monitoring. The
appropriate consultation, assessment and procedural benefits apply.

CHRONIC DIALYSIS TEAM FEE
Chronic Dialysis Team Fee is the all-inclusive benefit per patient per week for professional aspects of
managing chronic dialysis and end-stage renal failure in dialysis patients. It is a modality independent
fee and is equal in monetary value whether the dialysis is delivered in hospital, community or home
and whether it is haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The team fee includes the services of all
physicians routinely or periodically participating in the patient's dialysis treatment at:
a. the patient's principal treatment centre; or
b. at a place other than the patient's principal treatment centre (auxiliary treatment centre)
where 3 or more dialysis treatments are rendered to the patient during the 7-day period
referred to below.
The amount payable is in respect of a 7-day period of care, commencing at midnight Sunday and is
payable to the most responsible physician.
Except as set out below, the amount payable to another physician in respect of these services
rendered to a patient in respect of whom a claim is submitted and paid for this code is nil.
When a full 7-day period of team care is not rendered at the patient's principal treatment centre due to
absence of the patient with treatment at an auxiliary treatment centre, the amount claimed for
treatment at the principal treatment centre is reduced on a pro rata basis to equal 1/7 of the weekly
fee for each day that the patient is the responsibility of the principal treatment centre.
In addition to the common elements of insured services and the specific elements of Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Procedures, the team fee includes the following elements:
A. All consultations and visits for management and supervision of chronic dialysis treatments
regardless of frequency, type or location of service and includes chronic dialysis of hospital in-
patients.
B. All consultations and visits within the scope of practice of nephrology and general internal medicine
for assessment and treatment of complications of chronic dialysis and management of end-stage
renal disease and its complications in chronic dialysis patients.
C. All related counselling, interviews, psychotherapy of patients and family members.
D. All related case conferences.
The team fee does not include:
A. Assessments and special visit premiums for emergent calls to the emergency department.
B. Admission assessments and subsequent visits to acute care hospital in-patients for treatment of
complications of dialysis, chronic renal disease or intercurrent illness.
C. Any other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, including acute dialysis treatments.
D. Consultations and assessments by specialists in other than internal medicine or internal medicine
sub-specialists other than nephrologists.
E. Primary care by the patient's family physician.
F. Assessment by a renal transplantation specialist for entry into a transplantation program.

patient registration and drug requisition forms, establishment of intravenous access,
supervision of drug infusion and personal application of non-thermal diode laser for activation
of verteporfin.
PDT is insured only if the patient's clinical condition meets all of the following:
a. the patient has predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
secondary to either age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Presumed Ocular
Histoplasmosis Syndrome or pathologic myopia. Predominantly means that the area of
classic subfoveal CNV is equal to or greater than 50% of the total CNV lesion, as determined
by fluorescein angiography and documented by retinal photographs retained on the patient's
permanent medical record;
b. treatment is commenced within 30 months after initial diagnosis of predominantly classic
subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD, Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome or
pathologic myopia;
c. the patient's visual acuity is equal to or worse than 20/40; and
d. for each repeat therapy, recurrent or persistent CNV leakage is detected by fluorescein
angiography and documented by retinal photographs retained on the patient's permanent
medical record.
If the patient's clinical condition meets all the above criteria but retinal photographs are not
made prior to the procedure and retained on the patient's permanent medical record or the
procedure is not performed by an ophthalmologist, then PDT is not eligible for payment.
Maximum one PDT (unilateral or bilateral) per patient per day.

B.Basic DHTs are insured services payable at nil unless:
1. the professional component is rendered personally by a physician qualified by appropriate
education or training and experience to perform basic DHTs (qualified physician); and
2. the technical component is either rendered by a qualified physician or delegated by a qualified
physician to a person who is either an appropriately qualified employee of the physician or is an
audiologist who is a member of the College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists
of Ontario and employed by a public hospital.
C.Advanced DHTs are insured services payable at nil unless:
1. the professional component is personally rendered by an otolaryngologist or, for evoked
audiometry, a neurologist or by a non-certified physician with equivalent post-graduate
academic training (appropriate specialist or equivalent); and
2. the technical component is personally rendered by an appropriate specialist or equivalent, or
delegated by an appropriate specialist or equivalent to an audiologist who is a member of the
College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists of Ontario and is employed by the
appropriate specialist or equivalent or a public hospital.
D.Physicians submitting claims for DHTs shall maintain written records of appropriate qualifications
as indicated above for themselves and those employees to whom they may delegate the technical
component. Such records must be made available to the ministry on request. In the absence of
such records, the DHT is an insured service payable at nil.
[Commentary:
1.Delegated DHT services - To qualify for payment, delegated DHT services must comply with
the requirements for delegation of insured services described in the General Preamble
GP62.
2.Interpretation of DHT services - To qualify for payment, the physician who claims the
professional component must personally interpret the DHT and cannot delegate the
interpretation to another person.
3.Controlled Acts - Communicating to the individual or his or her personal representative a
diagnosis identifying a disease or disorder as the cause of symptoms of the individual in
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that the individual or his or her personal
representative will rely on the diagnosis, or prescribing a hearing aid for a hearing impaired
person are controlled acts. If a physician interprets a diagnostic hearing test without
communicating the diagnosis to the patient or his or her personal representative, a controlled
act has not occurred.
4.Fixed level screening audiometry is not an insured service.
5.DHTs at the request of or arranged by third party, e.g. school boards, employers or WSIB etc.
are not insured services. See Appendix A regarding third party service.]

“CPSO Standards” means the publication of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario
entitled “Independent Health Facilities, Clinical Practice Parameters and Facility Standards, Sleep
Medicine” in effect 6 months prior to the date upon which the sleep study was rendered.
“off-site premises” means off-site premises operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
“prior approval” means approved for payment as an insured service, before the service is rendered,
by the Ministry of Health following assessment on a case-by-case basis in accordance with all
medically relevant criteria.
[Commentary:
A “physician practicing sleep medicine” refers to a physician who meets the Medical Staff
requirements as defined in Chapter 2 of the “Independent Health Facilities, Clinical Practice
Parameters and Facility Standards, Sleep Medicine, September 2010 from the CPSO.]
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Sleep Studies are divided into a professional component listed in the columns headed with a "P", and
a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H" (the technical component).
The specific elements for the technical component H include the specific elements for the technical
component of non-invasive diagnostic procedures listed in the Preamble to Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Procedures.
If the physician is physically present during the study, the physician’s physical presence is a specific
element of the technical and professional components.
OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
For services rendered outside a hospital or off-site premises, the only fees payable under the Health
Insurance Act are for the professional component listed under the “P” column (use suffix C). Costs for
the technical component of these services are only payable under the Integrated Community Health
Services Centres Act, 2023 and are listed in the Schedule of Facility Costs.
Sleep studies are subject to limits or maximums set out below. Unless otherwise specifically provided,
service(s) in excess of limits are not insured services except when prior approval to exceed the limit is
obtained from the MOH. Despite the foregoing, where prior approval to exceed a limit is not requested
from the MOH but the service would otherwise satisfy one or more of the conditions for which prior
approval to exceed the limit is routinely granted (had prior approval been requested) any service in
excess of the limit is not eligible for payment.

medicine is not eligible for payment except:
a.For the therapeutic study that immediately follows an initial diagnostic or repeat
diagnostic study where:
i. the time interval is such that it is unlikely the clinical circumstances of the patient has
changed; and
ii. the physician practicing sleep medicine has previously assessed the patient and
documented the applicable decisions with respect to the performance of the
therapeutic study; or
b.In exceptional circumstances where the physician can demonstrate to the ministry upon
request that the CPSO standards are satisfied with the use of a clinical protocol or
approved medical directive.
[Commentary:
1.An example of an exceptional circumstance may be where a patient is required to travel a
long distance to a sleep facility and requires an initial diagnostic or repeat diagnostic study
followed by a therapeutic study on a subsequent night. For payment purposes, a pre-study
assessment by a physician practicing sleep medicine is not required provided the therapeutic
study is rendered in accordance with a clinical protocol or medical directive that has been
approved by an authority other than a physician affiliated with the sleep facility (e.g. a
Medical Advisory Committee for a sleep clinic affiliated with a hospital). The physician should
be prepared to provide any necessary supporting documentation to the ministry upon
request.
2.Prior approval, where required, will typically be dependent on the physician demonstrating
that the study is generally accepted as necessary for the patient under the circumstances.
3.Sleep studies that require prior approval also require a pre-study assessment by a physician
practicing sleep medicine. It is this assessment upon which the request for prior approval is
considered.

first visit to the physician’s office. The specific elements for each visit are those for
assessments (see General Preamble GP21).
e. Attendance at labour is a service of being in constant or periodic attendance on a patient,
during stages one and two of labour but without completion of the delivery, to provide all
aspects of care. This includes the initial assessment, and such subsequent assessments as
may be indicated, including ongoing monitoring of the patient’s conditions, intervening
except where intervention is a separately billable service. The specific elements are those of
assessments (see General Preamble GP21) except element H, but include providing
premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for any aspects of the specific elements of the
service that are performed outside the place in which the encounter(s) with the patient
occurs.
f. Attendance at delivery, specific elements as for Surgical Assistants’ Services (see General
Preamble GP85).
For all other procedures listed in this section the specific elements are those of IOP surgical
procedures identified with prefix # (see Surgical Preamble SP1) except for removal of Shirodkar
suture for which the specific elements are those for surgical IOP procedures not identified with prefix
#.
Fee schedule codes listed below which do not include providing all premises, equipment and
personnel used to perform the specific elements of the service are identified with prefix #.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. A prenatal major assessment includes a full history, and an examination of all parts or systems
(and may include a detailed examination of one or more parts or systems), an appropriate
record and advice to the patient. All other prenatal visits include the necessary history,
examination, appropriate record and advice to the patient. All prenatal visits (major and minor
and high risk) include pregnancy-related counselling as a form of providing advice to the patient
or the patient’s representative.
A prenatal general assessment is payable after another general assessment only if the reason
for the first assessment does not pertain to the establishment of the antenatal care.
Normal (uncomplicated) prenatal care includes a prenatal general assessment visit, then
monthly visits to 28 weeks, followed by visits every 2nd week to 36 weeks, then weekly visits
until delivery. However, complicated pregnancies may require additional visits. Labour, delivery
and postpartum care are listed separately.
2. If an uncomplicated obstetrical patient is transferred from one physician to another physician for
obstetrical care, the appropriate assessment benefit may be claimed by the second physician,
followed by prenatal visits. This statement does not apply to physicians substituting for each
other or when the second physician sees the patient for the first time in labour. If the obstetrical
patient is referred to a consultant for obstetrical care because of the complexity, obscurity or
seriousness of the case, the consultant may claim a consultation in addition to the prenatal
visits.
3. Illnesses resulting from or associated with pregnancy or false labour requiring added home or
hospital visits, shall be claimed on a per visit basis.
4. When a pregnant patient visits her physician for a condition unrelated to her pregnancy and
apart from her routine scheduled prenatal visits, the physician may claim the appropriate
assessment.
5. Fee schedule codes in this section are subject to the provisions of the Surgical Preamble where
applicable.
6. An assessment is payable for illness resulting from, or associated with, pregnancy or false
labour even if the patient progresses to delivery within the next two days. This does not apply to
patients who are assessed in the first stage of labour and admitted, or are transferred, to the
delivery room from the antenatal floor in labour.
7. The listings under the heading Referred Services may be claimed by the consultant physician in
addition to the appropriate consultation or visit fee. They may not be claimed by physicians
providing obstetrical care to their own patients.
8. If a consultant is requested by another physician to perform a surgical induction of labour, or
emergency removal of a Shirodkar suture (except at delivery) assuming someone else has
inserted the suture, the consultant should claim a consultation fee for this(these) service(s).
9. Medical induction or stimulation of labour may be claimed once per pregnancy by any one
physician and only when carried out for a recognized obstetrical complication(s). The fee listed
is applicable regardless of the time spent by the physician, therefore, detention may not be
claimed.

10.The listings for “Attendance at labour and delivery” and for “Attendance of obstetric
consultant(s) at delivery” may not be claimed by any physician when a patient is transferred to a
second physician for normal obstetrical care.
11. Ordinary immediate care of the newborn is included in the labour-delivery fee and when the
service is rendered by the anaesthetist, it is included in the anaesthetic benefit. A life
threatening emergency situation requiring active resuscitation of the newborn provided by any
physician may be claimed under codes G521, G522, G523. When indicated, endotracheal
intubation and tracheo-bronchial toilet should be billed under G211 and not as G521, G522,
G523.
12.When an obstetrician routinely transfers all newborns to another physician, the latter may not
claim a consultation for these transferals. If the baby is well, the physician should claim newborn
care in hospital plus attendance at maternal delivery (H007/H267) if this service is provided. If
the baby is sick, the physician may claim a general assessment and attendance at maternal
delivery (H007/H267) if this service is provided plus daily visits for as long as his/her services
are required.
13.If an obstetrician who normally cares for newborns him/herself or transfers the care of newborns
to a family physician, refers a newborn to a paediatrician because of the complexity, obscurity or
seriousness of the case, the latter may claim for this service according to the following
guidelines:
a. If attendance at maternal delivery is provided, C263 may be claimed in addition to H267 if a
general assessment of the baby is carried out. A postnatal consultation of the baby, (C265)
may not be claimed in addition to attendance at maternal delivery (H267).
b. If attendance at maternal delivery (H267) is not provided, a postnatal consultation (C265)
may be claimed, if rendered, whether or not a prenatal consultation has already been
claimed.
14.Physicians may claim for assisted breech delivery (P020) when the service includes
spontaneous delivery to the umbilicus, with extraction of the shoulders, arms and head.
15.See General Preamble GP104 for After Hours Premiums.
16.If claims are being submitted in coded form, the obstetrician should add the suffix “A” to the
listed procedural code, the assistant should add the suffix “B” to the listed procedural code, and
the anaesthetist should add the suffix “C” to the listed procedural code.

PREAMBLE
OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
FOR DEFINITION OF THE ROLE OF THE SURGICAL ASSISTANT - SEE GENERAL
PREAMBLE GP85.
FOR DEFINITION OF THE ROLES OF THE ANAESTHESIOLOGIST - SEE GENERAL
PREAMBLE GP92.
With the exception of the listings in the “Consultations and Visits” section, all references to surgeon in
this Schedule are references to any physician performing the surgical procedure.
1. If the surgeon is required to perform a service(s) not usually associated with the original surgical
procedure, he/she may claim for these on a fee-for-service basis.
If special visits to hospital are required at any time post-operatively, the surgeon may claim the
minimum special visit premiums even if the basic hospital visit fees may not be claimed (under
these circumstances the hospital visits should be claimed on an N/C ($00.00) basis).
The surgical benefit as noted above does not include the major pre-operative visit - i.e. the
consultation or assessment fee which may be claimed when the decision to operate is made
and the operation is scheduled, regardless of the time interval between the major pre-operative
visit and surgery.
The hospital or day care admission assessment (consultation, repeat consultation, general or
specific assessment or re-assessment, partial assessment) may not be claimed by the surgeon
unless it happens to be the major pre-operative visit as defined above.
Routine subsequent hospital visits may be claimed for visits rendered more than two days prior
to surgery. Other visits (excluding admission assessments) prior to admission may be claimed
for in addition to the surgical fee.
Because the number of hospital visits is limited to three per week after the fifth week of
hospitalization and six per month after the thirteenth week of hospitalization, the starting point
for calculating the number of hospital visits is based on the date of admission if the operating
surgeon has admitted the patient or the date of referral if the patient has been referred to the
operating surgeon while in hospital.
The listed benefit for a procedure normally includes repair of any iatrogenic complications
occurring during the course of the surgery performed by the same surgeon. Other major
interventions should be handled on an individual basis. The surgical benefit includes the
generally accepted surgical components of the procedure.
2. When a physician makes a special visit to perform a non-elective surgical procedure, he/she
may claim the following benefits for procedures commencing:
a. 07:00h -17:00h - Monday to Friday
A consultation (if the case is referred) or the appropriate assessment, the appropriate
special visit premium plus the procedural benefit.
b. 17:00h - 07:00h - Any night or on Saturdays/Sundays or Holidays

3. When more than one procedure is carried out by a surgeon under the same anaesthesia or
within 14 days during the same hospitalization for the same condition, the full benefit applies to
the major procedure and 85% of the listed benefit(s) applies to the other procedure(s)
performed unless otherwise stated in the Preamble(s) or Schedule. The above statement
applies to staged or bilateral procedures but does not apply when a normal appendix or simple
ovarian or para-ovarian cyst is removed incidentally during an operation, for which no claim
should be made.
4. When a subsequent operation becomes necessary for the same condition because of a
complication or for a new condition, the full benefit should apply for each procedure.
5. When a subsequent non-elective procedure is done for a new condition by the same surgeon,
the full benefit will apply to each procedure. When a subsequent elective procedure is done for
a different condition within 14 days during the same hospitalization by the same surgeon, the
benefit for the lesser procedure shall be reduced by 15%.
6. When different operative procedures are done by two different surgeons under the same
anaesthesia for different conditions, the benefit will be 100% of the listed benefit for each
condition. Under these circumstances, the basic assistant’s benefit should not be claimed by
either operating surgeon; however time units may be claimed.
7. As a general rule, when elective bilateral procedures are performed by two surgeons at the
same time, one surgeon should claim for the surgical procedures and the other surgeon should
claim the assistant’s benefit.
8. Where two surgeons are working together in surgery in which neither a team fee nor other
method of billing is set out in the benefit schedule, the surgeon should identify him/herself as
the operating surgeon and claim accordingly; the surgeon who is assisting the operating
surgeon should identify him/herself as such and claim the assistant’s benefit.
Where the second or assistant surgeon is brought into the case on a consultation basis, he/she
may, when indicated, claim a consultation as well but should be prepared to justify it on an IC
basis.
Except where otherwise provided in this Schedule, if the nature or complexity of a procedure
requires more than one operating surgeon, each providing a separate service in his/her own
specialized field, e.g. one surgeon carries out the ablative part and another surgeon the
reconstructive part of the procedure, then each surgeon should claim the listed benefit for his/
her services. This statement applies when the additional procedure(s) are not the usual
components of the main procedure. If one surgeon, in addition to performing a specialized
portion of a procedure, acts as an assistant during the remainder of the procedure, he/she may
also claim time units for assisting.
When surgical procedures are rendered to trauma patients who have an Injury Severity Score
(ISS) of greater than 15 for individuals age 16 or more, or an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of
greater than 12 for individuals less than age 16, and it is required that two surgeons perform
components of the same procedure, the full surgical fee for that procedure is payable to each
surgeon.
[Commentary:
The full surgical fee is payable to each surgeon for surgical procedures rendered either on the
day of the trauma or within 24 hours of the trauma.]

9. Unless otherwise stated, the listed benefits are for unilateral procedures only.
10.When a procedure is performed, a procedural benefit, if listed, should be claimed. Substitution
of consultation and/or visit benefits for procedural benefits (except as in paragraph 11), is not in
keeping with the intent of the benefit schedule.
11. When a surgical benefit (non-IOP, Complete Care, Fracture or Dislocation) is less than the
surgical consultation benefit, and the case is referred, a physician may claim a surgical
consultation benefit instead of the surgical benefit. However, to avoid the consultation being
counted as such under the Ministry of Health limitation rules on the number of consultations
allowed per year, the physician should claim the consultation fee under the surgical procedure
nomenclature or code. Since the consultation is replacing a procedural benefit which includes
the pre- and post-operative and surgical care, no additional claims beyond the consultation
should be made.
12.If a physician performs a minor surgical procedure and during the same visit assesses and
treats the patient for another completely unrelated and significant problem involving another
body system, the physician should claim for the procedure as well as the appropriate
assessment.
13.Where a procedure is listed with a “Z” code, the procedure is an “Independent Operative
Procedure (IOP)”. If the major pre-operative visit is rendered in the previous 12-month period
prior to the IOP service by the same physician, only the following assessment services are
eligible for payment on the same day prior to the IOP service:
a. a minor assessment if rendered by a General and Family Physician; or
b. a partial assessment if rendered by a specialist.
When the major preoperative assessment is rendered on the same day as the IOP, no other
consultation or assessment is eligible for payment if rendered prior to the IOP service by the
same physician on the same day.
When multiple or bilateral IOP are performed at the same time by the same physician, the
listed procedural benefits should be claimed in full but the pre- and post-operative benefits
should be claimed as if only one procedure had been performed.
When an IOP service is rendered on the same day as a non-IOP service by the same
physician, the terms and conditions for payment as described in the ‘Surgical Services which
are not listed as a "Z" code’ section of this Schedule are also applicable to the IOP service(s).
14.When procedures are specifically listed under Surgical Procedures, surgeons should use these
listings rather than applying one of the plastic surgery listed fees under Skin and Subcutaneous
Tissue in the Integumentary System Surgical Procedures section of this Schedule.
15.For excision of tumours not specifically listed in this Schedule, claims should be made on an IC
basis (code R993). Independent Consideration also will be given (under code R990) to claims
for other unusual but generally accepted surgical procedures which are not listed specifically in
the Schedule (excluding non-major variations of listed procedures). In submitting claims,
physicians should relate the service rendered to comparable listed procedures in terms of
scope and difficulty (see General Preamble GP12).

16.Cosmetic or esthetic surgery: means a service to enhance appearance without being
medically necessary. These services are not insured benefits (see Appendix D.)
17.Reconstructive surgery: is surgery to improve appearance and/or function to any area altered
by disease, trauma or congenital deformity. Although surgery solely to restore appearance may
be included in this definition under certain limited conditions, emotional, psychological or
psychiatric grounds normally are not considered sufficient additional reason for coverage of
such surgery. Appendix D of this Schedule describes the conditions under which surgery for
alteration of appearance only may be a benefit. Physicians should submit requests to their
regional OHIP Office for authorization of any proposed surgery which may fall outside of
Ministry of Health coverage. (See Appendix D.)
18.Additional claims for biopsies performed when a surgeon is operating in the abdominal or
thoracic cavity will be given Independent Consideration.
19.When a listed procedure is performed and no anaesthetic is required, the procedure should be
claimed under the “local anaesthetic” listing.
20.Except as described in the paragraph below, when a physician administers an anaesthetic,
nerve block and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in
conjunction with a diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs
on the same patient, the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication
is not eligible for payment.
A major or minor peripheral nerve block, major plexus block, neuraxial injection (with or without
catheter) or intrapleural block (with or without catheter) for post-operative pain control (with a
duration of action more than 4 hours) is eligible for payment as G224 when rendered in
conjunction with a procedure which the physician performs on the same patient.
[Commentary:
For additional information, refer to the Nerve Blocks - Acute Pain Management, Nerve Blocks -
Interventional Pain Injections or Nerve Blocks - Peripheral/Other sections of the Schedule.]
21.If claims are being submitted in coded form, the surgeon should add the suffix A to the listed
procedural code, the surgical assistant should add the suffix B to the listed procedural code and
the anaesthetist should add the suffix C to the listed procedural code.
22.When Z222/Z223 is claimed for a patient for whom the physician submits a claim for rendering
another insured service on the same day, the amount payable for Z222/Z223 is reduced to nil.
23.When a surgical procedure is attempted laparoscopically in the digestive system or the female
genital system, but requires conversion to a laparotomy, unless otherwise specified, the
diagnostic laparoscopic fee E860 is payable in addition to the procedural fee.

24.Morbidly obese patients
E676 is eligible for payment once per patient per physician in addition to the amount eligible for
payment for the major surgical procedure(s) where a morbidly obese patient undergoes major
surgery to the neck, thorax, peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum, pelvis, or hip and:
a. the patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 40 for major surgery on the thorax,
peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum, pelvis, or hip, or a BMI greater than 45 for major surgery
on the neck;
b. the surgery is rendered under general anaesthesia using either an open technique for the
neck, thorax, or hip, or an open or laparoscopic technique for the peritoneal cavity, pelvis,
retroperitoneum; and
c. the principal surgical technique is neither aspiration, core or fine needle biopsy, dilation,
endoscopy, mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, cautery, ablation nor catheterization.

Medical record requirements:
E676 is only eligible for payment when the BMI is recorded in the patient's permanent medical
record.
[Commentary:
E676 is not eligible for payment if the surgery is rendered under local anaesthesia.]
25.Lysis of extensive intra-abdominal adhesions and/or scarring e.g. post radiation
E673 is payable to the surgeon in addition to the fee for the major intra-abdominal procedure
only when lysis requires at least 60 minutes beyond the average duration of the major
procedure. E673 less than 60 minutes in duration or rendered in conjunction with E718 is an
insured service payable at nil.
# E673 Lysis of extensive intra-abdominal adhesions .................. add 62.05
26.Payment for all surgical procedures includes payment for any intraoperative monitoring of the
patient, if rendered.
27.Cancelled surgery – surgical services
a. If the procedure is cancelled prior to induction of anaesthesia, the service constitutes a
subsequent hospital visit.
b. When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled due to a complication prior to
commencement of surgery and the surgeon has scrubbed but is not required to do anything
further, the service constitutes E006A and the amount payable is calculated by adding the
time units to 6 basic units and multiplying by the surgical assistant’s unit fee.
c. If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced but prior to its completion, the
service is eligible for payment under independent consideration (R990).
[Commentary:
Submit claim for R990 by adding the time units to the listed procedural basic units and
multiplying by the surgical assistant’s unit fee and attach a copy of the operative report for
review by a medical consultant.]
Note:
For the purpose of cancelled surgery, time units for the surgeon are calculated in the same way
as time units for the surgical assistant (see General Preamble GP85).
28.Bariatric surgery
S120 (gastric bypass or partition), S189 (intestinal bypass) and S114 (sleeve gastrectomy) are
insured services only when all of the following four criteria are satisfied:
1.Presence of morbid obesity that has persisted for at least the preceding 2 years, defined as:
a.Body mass index (BMI) exceeding 40; or
b.BMI greater than 35 in conjunction with any of the following severe co-morbidities:
i. Coronary heart disease;
ii. Diabetes mellitus;
iii. Clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea (i.e. patient meets the criteria for

Transplant recipient: Submit claims using the transplant recipient’s Ontario health insurance
number only.
If the recipient is from out-of-province, submit claims using the recipient’s provincial health
insurance number.
Transplant donor: Submit claims using the transplant donor’s Ontario health insurance
number.
For a donor with a health insurance number from another province or for a donor from another
country, submit claims using the Ontario recipient’s health insurance number.
In circumstances where the donor is an Ontario resident but the health insurance number
cannot be obtained despite reasonable efforts to do so, use the recipient’s Ontario health
insurance number.

MOHS MICROGRAPHIC SURGERY
Definition/Required elements of service
Mohs micrographic surgery is eligible for payment when rendered for a lesion that is a
histologically confirmed cutaneous malignancy (including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
carcinoma, malignant melanoma, lentigo maligna, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans,
sebaceous carcinoma, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, Merkel cell
carcinoma, eccrine carcinoma, extramammary Paget's disease, leiomyosarcoma and primary
cutaneous adenocarcinoma); and that meets one or more of the following conditions:
a. a lesion with clinical margins greater than 1.5 cm;
b. a lesion located in an anatomically sensitive area, in particular but not limited to the
periocular, perinasal, perilabial, and periauricular surfaces, or the nose;
c. a recurrent malignancy that has not responded to prior therapy;
d. a malignant lesion in a patient with immunodeficiency or genodermatoses predisposing to
widespread skin cancers, such as basal cell nevus syndrome;
e. a histologically aggressive lesion (such as a basal cell carcinoma that is sclerosing,
infiltrative, baso-squamous, or micronodular, or a squamous cell carcinoma that is poorly
differentiated, or demonstrates peri-neural/lymphatic/vascular involvement) at any anatomic
site.
# R081 - Initial cut, including debulking............................................. 6 315.45 7
# E524 - one or more additional cuts, to R081 ......................... add 273.45
Note:
1.R081 and E524 are eligible for payment only to physicians with generally accepted
specialized training in Mohs surgery.
[Commentary:
An example of generally accepted specialized training is the successful completion of a
fellowship accredited by the American College of Mohs Surgery.]
1.R081 is eligible for payment only when the preparation of slides is rendered or supervised by
the physician claiming R081 and all microscopic tissue sections are personally reviewed and
interpreted by the physician claiming R081. If a pathologist interprets or submits a claim for
analyzing histological slides prepared by the physician claiming R081, R081 and E524 are
not eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
In these circumstances, the physician should instead claim the appropriate fee code for
excising a malignant skin lesion.]
2.Closure of the resulting defect by undermining and advancement flaps is included in the
above fees. If more complicated closure is necessary, the service may be eligible for
payment using fee codes under skin flaps and grafts.
Payment rules:
1.R081 is eligible for payment once per lesion including when excision of the lesion is
completed over two or more days up to two weeks.

PLASTIC SURGERY PROCEDURES
[Commentary:
The setting of benefits covering the various procedures of plastic surgery is a very difficult
problem. Since many procedures are divided into stages which have to be considered in
assessing a fee, it is felt that all such plastic surgical procedures should be classed by the
responsible specialist as very minor, intermediate, major or extensive major. Benefits should be
claimed according to procedures set forth in the tariff, except in cases which are difficult to
define, in which case “I.C” should be the basis of the claim.]
The minimum benefit for each would be as follows:
# R150 Very minor............................................................................... 92.30 6
# R151 Minor....................................................................................... 6 140.25 6
# R152 Intermediate............................................................................ 6 259.20 7

1.Descriptive details of procedure (e.g. operative report) should be submitted with claims for
codes R150 - R154 for professional assessment.
2.Taking of skin by a surgeon for grafting by an Oral Surgeon - claim as R150.
3.R150, R151, R152, R153, and R154 are not eligible for payment for the repair of any

FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS
1. For fractures or dislocations requiring open or closed reduction or no reduction, the major pre-
operative visit, i.e. consultation or appropriate assessment, may be claimed in addition to the
listed benefits.
2. OPEN REDUCTION shall mean the treatment of a fracture and/or dislocation by either closed
intramedullary fixation or by an operative procedure to expose the fracture. The benefits include
fixation by internal or external devices.
3. CLOSED REDUCTION shall mean the reduction of a fracture or dislocation by non-operative
methods (including traction).
4. NO REDUCTION shall mean the treatment of a fracture or dislocation by any other method and
includes the use of the initial external support other than a simple splint. No reduction, rigid
immobilization, means that the device used to achieve a rigid immobilization is custom-molded
and is applied by the physician. In cases involving no reduction, application of a simple splint,
such as a metal splint, is not billable as rigid immobilization (visit fees only apply).

5. The service includes all related follow-up treatment by the physician for 2 weeks from the date
of treatment of the fracture or dislocation except:
a. for the first and second post-treatment visits to a hospital in-patient;
b. for the subsequent visit by the MRP - day of discharge (C124);
c. for the first post-treatment visit when the patient is no longer a hospital in-patient;
d. if additional reductions are necessary;
e. if the patient is transferred to another surgeon; or
f. if the patient is a paraplegic.
[Commentary:
The first and second post-treatment visits in hospital for 2 weeks from the date of treatment of
the fracture or dislocation are payable at the specialty specific subsequent visit fee.]
6. In multiple fractures or dislocations, the benefit for the major fracture or dislocation shall be
100% and the benefit for the other fractures or dislocations is 85%. When no procedural benefit
is applicable, but that fracture or dislocation necessitates hospitalization or concurrent care over
that demanded by the major injury, a visit benefit may be claimed in addition to other procedural
benefits.
7. For repeat reductions (closed or open) for the same fracture or dislocation, the full benefit
should be claimed for the final reduction and after care; previous reductions by the same
surgeon should be claimed at 85%.
8. Emergency splinting of fractures in the emergency department should be on the basis of
appropriate visit benefit, plus application of cast if appropriate.
9. Transferred cases:
a. When patients are transferred to a chronic or convalescent facility, additional visit benefits on
a chronic care basis shall be allowed to other than the operating surgeon (and also to the
surgeon after 2 weeks).
b. When patients are transferred to another physician for after care of fractures and
dislocations treated by closed or no reduction, the physician rendering the initial care should
claim 75% of the listed fee and the surgeon rendering subsequent care should claim visit
fees except where otherwise specified. In cases involving open reduction, the percentage
should be 80% for the surgeon providing the initial care.
c. In cases where the original physician's attempts to reduce a fracture or dislocation under
general anaesthesia is unsuccessful, and the patient is referred to another physician for
definitive care, the original physician should claim 75% of the listed fee.
10.Pseudoarthrosis repair/reconstruction is only payable when a fracture requires additional
reconstruction because of inadequate healing at least 4 months following the original injury.
Pseudoarthrosis repair/reconstruction includes bone graft, debridement, osteotomy and internal
or external fixation other than the use of an intramedullary nail with distal and proximal locking
screws, or circular external fixation if performed.
11. For fractures and dislocations not requiring reduction, visit fees apply unless a specific fee is
listed. If the listed fee is less than the consultation, the consultation should be claimed under the

ORTHOPAEDIC TUMOUR SURGERY
R226 Biopsy of suspected sarcoma, or resection of a complex bone
or complex soft tissue tumour(s), per 15 minutes .............. 10 100.00 15
Payment rules:
1.R226 is eligible for payment only to an oncological orthopaedic surgeon with fellowship
training in orthopaedic oncology. Documentation of fellowship training must be provided to
the ministry prior to submitting a claim for R226.
[Commentary:
Surgeons eligible to claim R226 will typically be working within a multidisciplinary sarcoma
subspecialty group.]
2.R226 is a time based service. Except when rendering the services of a surgical assistant,
time calculation for the purpose of R226A includes all resection and reconstruction
components of the procedure rendered by the physician claiming R226A.
[Commentary:
For any period of time that a surgeon claiming R226A renders the services of an assistant, the
time spent assisting constitutes surgical assist time and is not eligible for payment as time for
the purpose of R226A.]
3.Biopsy of suspected sarcoma, or resection of a complex bone or complex soft tissue
tumour(s) is not eligible for payment as R226 when rendered in conjunction with another
procedure(s) by the same surgeon when the biopsy or tumour resection is not the major
procedure.
[Commentary:
In these circumstances (payment rule 3), use the appropriate fee code listing in the Schedule
under biopsy or excision of bone or soft tissue.]
4.R226 is eligible for payment for complex tumour resection by amputation only when the
tumour resected is malignant.
[Commentary:
For other tumour resection by amputation, use the appropriate fee code listing in the Schedule
under amputation.]
5.If the nature, complexity and/or length of the procedure require(s) two oncological
orthopaedic surgeons to render components of the same procedure simultaneously or
sequentially, R226A is eligible for payment to each surgeon.
Claims submission instructions:
Submit R226A claims for a second surgeon using the manual review indicator and
accompanied by operative report.
[Commentary:
In accordance with the Surgical Preamble, if a surgeon who is not an oncological orthopaedic
surgeon renders a specialized component of the procedure (eg reconstructive flaps or grafts),
the surgeon should claim the appropriate fee code(s) from the Schedule for the service(s)
rendered.]

6.Time calculation commences when the surgeon begins the procedure and ends when the
surgeon leaves the operating room.
7.Time unit calculation is based on full 15 minute time units.
Medical record requirements:
This service is eligible for payment only if start and stop times of the service are recorded in the
patient's permanent medical record.
[Commentary:
Any surgeon rendering R226A should also record in the patient's permanent medical record the
start and stop times of surgical assistant services when rendered.]

# R699 Knee arthroscopy set-up, non-degenerative disorders of the
knee or acutely locked knee. Includes when rendered for
synovial biopsy and/or resection or trimming of plica......... 6 97.35 7
Payment rules:
1.A knee procedure listed in the Knee section of the Schedule performed arthroscopically is
eligible for payment in addition to R687 or R699 if that procedure is not described as a
component of R699 or described by an E-add-on code to R699.
2.Arthroscopic E-add-on codes listed below are not eligible for payment in addition to R687 or
R699 when the service described by the E-code is a generally accepted component of a
procedure described in Payment Rule #1.
3.E476 is not eligible for payment with R687 or R699 unless there is:
a.evidence of an intra-articular loose body causing mechanical symptoms; or
b.a symptomatic loose screw.
4.E-codes from the arthroscopy section other than E494, E495 and E476 are not eligible for
payment with R687.
5.Except where prior approval has been given by a MOH medical consultant, E494 and E495
are not eligible for payment with R687 unless all of the following criteria are met:
a.Kellgren-Lawrence knee osteoarthritis grade less than 3 as documented on standing
knee x-rays performed within the last 12 months; and
b.Unstable chondral pathology or meniscal tear causing mechanical symptoms which have
not responded to a minimum of six months active non-surgical treatment.
6.R687 is eligible for payment in all patients with degenerative disease when a diagnostic
arthroscopy is required prior to or in conjunction with reconstructive proximal tibial or distal
femoral osteotomy.
[Commentary:
1.R687 is an uninsured service for any of the following:
a.arthroscopic lavage of the knee alone (without debridement) for osteoarthritis;
b.when the criteria in payment rule 5 are not met and no other arthroscopic E-add-on codes
are medically necessary; or
c.when prior approval of R687 and E494 or E495 is denied by the ministry.
2.Arthroscopic lavage of the knee alone (without debridement) is not recommended for any
stage of osteoarthritis.
3.The routine use of debridement for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee is not
recommended by the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC). See http://
www.hqontario.ca/evidence/publications-and-ohtac-recommendations/ohtas-reports-and-
ohtac-recommendations/arthroscopic-lavage-and-debridement.

purpose of surgical visualization alone.
[Commentary:
When E494 or E495 are claimed with R687, or E498 is claimed with R699 it is recommended
that the intra-articular pathology be documented with pre- and post-procedural photographic
images taken during arthroscopy which are archived in the permanent medical record where

Combined Abdominal-Vaginal Procedure for Stress Incontinence (Sling Procedure)
[Commentary:
Combined abdominal vaginal sling procedures are indicated for the management of stress
incontinence or genital prolapse, particularly following previous failed anti-incontinence
procedures of any kind, or a very large cystocoele. The procedure usually entails entry into the
space of Retzius through an abdominal approach (open or laparoscopic) in conjunction with an
anterior vaginal dissection (with or without cystoscopy) following which the sling material
(autologous, synthetic or xenograft) is passed through the perineal membrane, placed under
appropriate tension at the bladder neck, and sutured to Cooper’s ligament bilaterally.]
Payment rules:
1.Anti-prolapse procedures or other anti-incontinence procedures are not eligible for payment
when rendered with combined abdominal-vaginal procedures for stress incontinence (sling
procedures).
2.Cystoscopy (Z606) is not eligible for payment with combined abdominal-vaginal procedures
for stress incontinence (sling procedures) unless the cystoscopy is rendered for suspicion of
disease.
[Commentary:
Those procedures listed under the titles “Following one previous failed procedure” or “Following
two or more previously failed procedures” are eligible for payment following failure of the
appropriate number of any listed procedure.]

[Commentary:
1.Current research supports “treat and extend” injection protocols with most studies supporting
that an average of approximately 8 injections per year will control disease. Patients should
only receive more than 8 injections per year in the presence of clinical and diagnostic
evidence of disease instability.
2.Refer to E023C on GP100 for anaesthesia services other than procedural sedation rendered
in support of E186, E187, or E149.
