Note:
E025C is only eligible for payment for an unanticipated transfusion of blood during a surgical
procedure where:
1.greater than 70 ml/kg of red blood cells are transfused for a patient with a weight up to 50 kg;
or
2.10 or more units of red blood cells are transfused for a patient with a weight exceeding 50 kg.
[Commentary:
1.For E010, BMI is calculated by dividing the patient’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of
the patient’s height (in metres).
2.E025C is defined by the amount of blood transfused rather than the amount of blood loss.
The volume of blood transfused does not include blood collected from a cell saver,
hemodilution techniques or non-red blood cell components.]
Payment rules:
1. In the description of E022C, E016C, E017C and E020C, reference to ASA level for Physical

3.Local infiltration or topical anaesthesia used as an anaesthetic for any procedure is not
eligible for payment.]
Note:
For the purposes of anaesthesia services the following definitions apply:
1.Procedural Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients
respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile
stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous
ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
2.Deep Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot
be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. The
ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require
assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate.
Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
3.General Anaesthesia is a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not
arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory
function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway,
and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous
ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function
may be impaired.
ANAESTHESIA ADMINISTERED BY SAME PHYSICIAN PERFORMING A PROCEDURE
1. Except as described in paragraph 2, when a physician administers an anaesthetic, nerve block
and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in conjunction with a
diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs on the same patient,
the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication is not eligible for
payment.

2. A major or minor peripheral nerve block, major plexus block, neuraxial injection (with or without

by Telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service is a specific element of the
preceding service and should not be separately claimed. This includes reporting results of
related procedures and/or assessments (when professionally appropriate to report without
additional patient assessment) and monitoring the patient’s condition remotely until the next
medically necessary assessment.
For clarity, administrative staff may co-ordinate appointments and organize care in a manner
analogous to in-person encounters without violating this condition. Similarly, medically
necessary follow-up services may be organized by the provider (or by their staff) without
violating the condition. However, a physician-initiated call to “check-in” on a patient would not
be eligible for payment, nor would any telephone calls or Video encounters conducted for
administrative purposes (such as to inform patients of clinic closures or the availability of
remote services).
Furthermore, services are not eligible for payment when initiated by the physician (or the
physician’s staff) without a clear and medically necessary reason for doing so. For example,
the communication of normal lab work, unless medically necessary (in so far as the clinical
management of the patient is altered) should not be billed.
Physician-initiated communication to provide advice or guidance regarding a previously
rendered service is also not separately eligible/ billable. A common example of this would occur
when a patient is provided with a prescription along with instruction to fill it only upon receipt of
a positive test result. The call to inform the patient of the test result is not eligible for payment
as it would be considered a Specific Element of the initial (refer to: item F, GP15, Schedule of
Benefits).

CONSULTATIONS AND VISITS
VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
As a general rule, the provider should consider whether the remote encounter would have
occurred in their “in-person” practice. In circumstances where an in-person encounter would
not have taken place, it is unlikely that a claim for a virtual service could be supported.
Consultations, which arise from requests from other providers, would not violate the condition
in so far as the patient would have assented to the referral as part of their discussion with the
referring provider.]
7. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless personally performed by the physician
or rendered in accordance with the payment rules regarding supervision of a Medical Trainee.
8. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment for services provided to hospital inpatients or
patients in a Long-Term Care institution unless all of the following requirements have been met:
• The physician providing the service is not the patient's MRP.
• The hospital/Long-Term Care institution does not have a physician on staff and
present in the community with the expertise to render the necessary service, as
documented by the referring physician in the patient’s medical record.
• An assessment with a direct physical encounter by the referring physician must
have been completed within 30 days preceding a virtual in-patient specialist
consultation to confirm the need for a consultation.
9. Services involving a direct physical encounter must be made available by the physician
providing Comprehensive Virtual Care Services, or by the physician’s group, within a clinically
appropriate time-frame, if it becomes apparent during a Virtual Care Service that a service
involving a direct physical encounter is medically necessary, or if at the time of scheduling the
service the patient expresses preference for a service involving a direct physical encounter.
[Commentary:
For the purpose of this provision, with respect to specialist and GP Focused Practice
Physicians, a group is defined as: those physicians in the same hospital specialty call rotation,
or who are co-located in shared clinical physical space, and have shared access to the
patient’s medical record. For family and general practice physicians, a group is defined as:
Patient Enrollment Model physicians who are signatory or contracted to the same specific
group contract (i.e., as identified by the same group billing number), or those physicians who
are co-located in a shared clinical physical space and have shared access to the patient’s
medical record].
10.If during the course of a Virtual Care Service the modality changes (for example, a Telephone
service transitions into a Video service), only the service performed by the modality that
represents the greater part (more than 50%) of the time spent providing the Virtual Care Service
is payable. For time-based services, the combined time of both modalities will be used to
calculate the number of time units eligible for payment.
11. For time-based services, only time spent in direct communication with the patient or the
patient’s representative in the provision of the insured service will be used to calculate the
number of time units eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
Both the patient and physician must be located in Ontario for the services to be insured and
payable under OHIP (see section 37.1 of Regulation 552 under the HIA).]

SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Nuclear Medicine procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the columns headed
with a "P", and a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H". The technical
component of the procedure subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
In addition to the common elements, the components of Nuclear Medicine procedures include the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is(are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
Note:
1.Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
2.If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B
and C, these may be delegated to another physician.
3.Where the only component provided is interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure,
the specific elements A and C listed for the professional component are included in the
specific elements of the technical component.
For Technical Component H
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure(s).
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s representative,
whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretive report of the procedure to the
referring provider.
G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect(s) of A and D of the
professional component that is(are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is
performed.

PREAMBLE
OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for the technical
component H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional
component are submitted using listed fee code with suffix C. (e.g. J802C)
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health
Insurance Act are listed under P (use suffix C). Costs for the technical component of these
services are only billable under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.
3. With the exception of J818, J835, J821, J834, J880 or when SPECT is claimed, if quantification
or data manipulation is carried out in addition to visual inspection of imaging studies, add 30%
to the appropriate professional benefit. For claim purposes, use prefix “Y”. Such activity must
add significant diagnostic information not available by inspection alone and does not include
simple image enhancement techniques such as smoothing, background subtraction, etc.
Recording of images on videotape for replay and production of images on the video display of a
computer do not in themselves justify the additional benefit. The claims for cardiac wall motion
studies and calculation of ventricular ejection fraction (J811 and J813) already include an
allowance for data manipulation as a general rule and no additional benefit may be claimed.
The additional computer benefit may be claimed only when additional cardiac quantifications
are performed i.e. stroke volume ratio and volume response curves and/or phase analysis.
4. If examination of Brain, Lung, Liver or Spleen is limited to one view, the benefit (H and P) is to
be reduced by 50%.
5. Repeat studies on the same day may be claimed only after exercise or drug intervention.
6. When tomographic examination (SPECT) is billed, the 30% add-on referred to in paragraph 3
may not be claimed.
7. Costs for the technical component of services rendered in an ICHSC are listed in the Schedule
of Facility Costs.
8. The technical and professional fee components for myocardial perfusion imaging /
echocardiogram/exercise stress test/stress echocardiogram are not eligible for payment in the
routine preoperative preparation or screening of a patient for surgery where the patient will
undergo a low risk procedure or has a low risk of perioperative cardiac complications, unless
there is a clinical indication requiring myocardial perfusion imaging/exercise stress test/cardiac
stress echo studies other than solely for preoperative preparation of the patient.
[Commentary:
1.Studies have indicated that for non cardiac surgery, there may be no clinical benefit and
there may be harm in performing functional cardiac testing in patients with low operative risk
and little or limited benefit in moderate risk patients. BMJ 2010, Jan 28; 340.
2.One example of a generally accepted guideline is the American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines that states:
a.Non invasive testing could be considered in patients with 1 to 2 risk factors and poor
functional capacity (less than 4 mets) who require intermediate risk surgery if it will
change management (class IIb)
b.Non invasive testing has not been show to be useful in patients with no clinical risk factors
undergoing intermediate risk non cardiac surgery (class III).
c.Non invasive testing has not been shown to useful in patients undergoing low risk non
cardiac surgery (class III)]

PREAMBLE
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Diagnostic Radiology procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the column
headed with a "P", and a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H". The technical
component of the procedures subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospital Act.
[Commentary:
As described in Regulation 552 of the Health Insurance Act, for a service to be insured, the
interpreting physician must physically be present in Ontario when the interpretation service is
rendered.]
In addition to the common elements, the components of Diagnostic Radiology procedures include the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component P
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate, and quality control of all elements of the technical component
of the procedure.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable (e.g. injections which are an integral part of the study) and of any fluoroscopy.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is (are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B and C,
these may be delegated to another physician who must personally perform the service. Element D
must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
For Technical Component H
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure or assisting in the performance of fluoroscopy.
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s
representative, whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretive report of the procedure to the
referring provider.
G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect(s) of A and D of the
professional component that is (are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is
performed.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
PREAMBLE
OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for technical component
H are submitted using the listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional component P are
submitted using the listed fee code with suffix C.
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health
Insurance Act are listed under the column P (use suffix C). Costs for the technical component of
these services are only claimed under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act,
2023. Costs for the technical component of services rendered in an ICHSC are listed in the
Schedule of Facility Costs.
3. Benefits for clinical procedures related to x-ray examinations are listed in the following section,
or under Diagnostic and Therapeutic or Surgical Procedures. ‘Clinical Procedures’, in this
context, are those by which contrast media are introduced, except oral or rectal administration
for study of the alimentary tract, and intravenous injections, which are an integral part of the
study, performed by the physician collecting the benefit for the procedure.
4. If less than the minimum number of views are performed, reduce listed fees by 25%.
5. If insured diagnostic radiology procedures yield abnormal findings or if they would yield
information which in the opinion of the radiologist would be insufficient governed by the needs of
the patient and the requirements of the referring provider or practitioner, the radiologist may add
further views and claim for them (if listed).
6. All benefits listed apply to unilateral examinations unless otherwise specified. When a
radiologist is asked to x-ray one extremity only, no additional claim should be made for
comparison x-rays initiated by the radiologist.
7. A stereo pair is to be counted as two views.
8. No additional claim is warranted for the use of the image intensifier in diagnostic radiology.
9. Complex head CT scans are meant to be multiplanar (multidirectional) head CT scans - to
include one or more of the following areas: pituitary fossa, posterior fossa, internal auditory
meati, orbits and related structures, the temporal bone and its contents and the
temporomandibular joints. X400, X401 and X188 are not to be billed in addition to those fees for
complex head studies.
10.Nasal bones or accessory nasal sinuses should not be routinely claimed in skull examination
requests.
11. Mandible X006 and Temporomandibular joints X007 are not both to be routinely claimed on the
same patient but only when specifically ordered.
12.Conventional films of the spine should not be routinely done and claimed for before
myelography. The necessity of having plain film studies of the spine prior to interpreting the
myelographic studies is obvious. It is not essential, however, that these be done at the
institution where the myelogram was done. If they have been done at an outside office, then it is
a matter for the radiologist and the referring provider to have the films available. If they cannot
be made available to the radiologist, it is an acceptable practice for him to do the required
procedure of these areas and to claim for them so that they may be available for interpretation
along with the myelographic study.
13.Lumbar or lumbosacral spine X028 does not include the entire sacrum. An x-ray of the sacrum
may be carried out and claimed for only when specifically indicated.

PREAMBLE
14.Three or more views of the chest should not be done routinely and claimed when a chest
examination is requested.
15.Chest studies should not be routinely done and claimed in mammography cases.
16.Fluoroscopy claims should not be submitted for any examination performed by the radiologist
where fluoroscopy is generally regarded as an integral part of the examinations e.g.
examinations of the GI tract, urinary tract, and special procedures.
17.‘Colon - air contrast’ may be claimed when performed according to generally accepted criteria.
The colon should be scrupulously prepared. Five to eight full size views of the abdomen should
be obtained after fluoroscopically controlled introduction of air and barium.
18.‘Oesophagus, stomach and duodenum - double contrast’ presupposes the introduction of gas,
the use of antifoam agent and a suitable barium mixture.
19.'Pharynx and oesophagus - cine or videotape' (X106) should not be claimed routinely with X108
and X109 but only when specifically indicated.
20.Abdomen and chest studies should not be routinely done and claimed in gastrointestinal
examinations.
21.Abdomen and/or pelvis should not be routinely claimed in lumbar spine examination requests.
22.A survey film of the abdomen is a single view. The ordering of additional films should be left to
the discretion of the radiologist who should have the power to determine what examination is
adequate for a specific patient. Obviously, if progress of a long tube is being followed, a survey
film is sufficient. If, however, an intestinal obstruction is being followed, a single film is usually
inadequate.
23.No extra fee should be claimed for rapid sequence IVP.
24.Nephrotomography is covered by the listings for intravenous pyelogram and planigram.
25.Preoperative and Routine Chest X-rays
a. The technical and professional fee components for chest x-ray, X090, X091 and X092 are
not eligible for payment in the routine preoperative preparation or screening of a patient for
non-cardiac, non-thoracic surgery, unless there is a clinical indication requiring a chest x-ray
other than solely for preoperative preparation or screening of the patient.
[Commentary:
Examples of indications could include but are not limited to:
1.suspected active airway or airspace disease
2.workup of shortness of breath
3.metastatic workup]
b. The technical and professional fee components for chest x-ray, X090, X091 and X092 are
only eligible for payment when rendered for a patient who has symptoms, signs or an
indication supported by current clinical practice guidelines relevant to the individual patient’s
circumstances.
[Commentary:
Routine chest x-rays for screening or for admission to hospital without clinical indication are not
payable.]
26.X-ray or CT studies of the lumbar spine should not be routinely ordered or rendered for low back
pain without suspected or known pathology.

BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD) MEASUREMENT
H P
Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) - by axial technique only
Definition:
For the purpose of second and subsequent testing,
“high risk patient” means a patient:
1.at risk for accelerated bone loss (in the absence of other risk factors, patient age is deemed
not to place a patient at high risk for accelerated bone loss);
2.with osteopenia or osteoporosis on any previous BMD testing; or
3.with bone loss in excess of 1% per year as demonstrated by previous BMD testing.
“low risk patient” means a patient who is not a high risk patient.
Definition/Required elements of service:
BMD measurement by DXA is an insured service only when all the following conditions have
been met:
1.the service is rendered for the prevention and management of osteoporosis or osteopenia;
2.when more than one site is measured, the sites include both hip and spine and where
measurement of both hip and spine is not technically feasible the site measured consists of
either hip or spine.
[Commentary:
Measurement of hip and spine would be considered not technically feasible due to prosthesis
or deformity.]
Baseline test
X145 - one site............................................................................... 42.85 40.15
X146 - two or more sites ................................................................ 55.20 48.00
Second test - low risk patient
X152 - one site............................................................................... 42.85 40.15
X153 - two or more sites ................................................................ 55.20 48.00
Subsequent test - low risk patient
X142 - one site............................................................................... 42.85 40.15
X148 - two or more sites ................................................................ 55.20 48.00
Subsequent test - high risk patient
X149 - one site............................................................................... 42.85 40.15
X155 - two or more sites ................................................................ 55.20 48.00
Payment rules:
1.Patients are limited to one baseline test (X145 or X146) in their lifetime.
2.Second test - low risk patient (X152/X153) is limited to a maximum of one test rendered not
earlier than 36 months following the baseline test (X145/X146).
3.Subsequent test - low risk patient (X142/X148) is not eligible for payment when rendered
earlier than 60 months following the second or any subsequent test.

4.Any combination of services described by X152 or X153 that were rendered to a patient
between July 1, 2007 and April 1, 2008 for which claims were submitted and paid as insured
services under the Health Insurance Act constitutes, a “second test – low risk patient” for the
purpose of determining service maximums for a second or subsequent test - low risk patient,
and is deemed to have been rendered on July 1, 2010.
5.Any service described by X152 or X153 rendered between April 1, 2008 and July 1, 2010 for
which a claim was submitted and paid as an insured service under the Health Insurance Act
constitutes a subsequent test - low risk patient for the purpose of determining service
maximums for second or subsequent test – low risk patient and is deemed to have been
rendered on July 1, 2010.
6.Subsequent test - high risk patients (X149/X155) is limited to a maximum of one test every 12
months unless the ordering physician obtains written prior authorization from a medical
consultant.
[Commentary:
Authorization will be dependent on the ordering physician demonstrating that the test is
generally accepted as necessary for the patient under the circumstances.]
[Commentary:
1.Baseline, second test and subsequent tests should be ordered only in accordance with
current practice guidelines. In those situations where testing is ordered on a particular patient
for reasons that vary from the guidelines, the ordering physician should ensure that the
patient’s medical record sufficiently explains the justification for the test in this particular
case.
2.In the event a patient with a previous normal baseline test (X145/X146) or second test (X152/
X153) or normal subsequent test – low risk patient (X142/X148) meets any of the criteria
listed for high risk patients as stated above, the patient would be eligible for subsequent test
– high risk patient services (X149/X155) subject to the restriction stated in payment rule #6.
3.The 2002 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Osteoporosis in
Canada (reviewed in 2006) can be found at http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/167/10_suppl/

4.Individuals under age 65 without one major or two minor risk factors typically do not benefit
from BMD measurement.]

[Commentary:
An example of a generally accepted methodology for determining 10 year risk of coronary
heart disease is the Framingham Risk Score.
1.Studies have indicated that for non cardiac surgery, there may be no clinical benefit and
there may be harm in performing functional cardiac testing in patients with low operative risk
and little or limited benefit in moderate risk patients. BMJ 2010, Jan 28; 340.
2.One example of a generally accepted guideline is the American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines that states:
a.Non invasive testing could be considered in patients with 1 to 2 risk factors and poor
functional capacity (less than 4 mets) who require intermediate risk surgery if it will
change management (class IIb)
b.Non invasive testing has not been show to be useful in patients with no clinical risk factors
undergoing intermediate risk non cardiac surgery (class III).
c.Non invasive testing has not been shown to useful in patients undergoing low risk non
cardiac surgery (class III).]

[Commentary:
Life threatening critical care and other critical care
The duration of "life threatening critical care" and "other critical care" services that physicians
should document is the time they actually spend evaluating, managing, and providing care to
the critically ill or injured patient to the exclusion of all other work.
For example, time spent reviewing laboratory test results or discussing the critically ill patient's
care with other medical staff in the unit or at the nursing station on the floor would be included
in the definition of critical care, even when it does not occur at the bedside, if this time
represents their full attention to the management of the critically ill/injured patient.
Time spent involved in activities in any location other than the bedside, emergency department
or hospital floor where the patient is located cannot be claimed as the physician is not
immediately available to the patient.
Submit claims manually when the total time spent in providing "life threatening critical care" or
"other critical care" is greater than two (2) hours.]

was only one physician-in-charge during the treatment program; in this sense, the daily fees are
team fees.
B. When claiming Critical, Ventilatory, Neonatal Intensive Care or Comprehensive Care fees no other
Critical Care codes may be paid to the same physician(s).
C. Other physicians other than those providing Critical Care or Comprehensive Care may claim the
appropriate consultation, visit and procedure fees not listed in the fee schedule for Critical Care.
These claims will be adjudicated by the Medical Consultant in an Independent Consideration basis.
D. If Ventilatory Support only is provided, for example, by the anaesthetist(s), claims should then be
made under Ventilatory Support. Comprehensive Care and Neonatal Intensive Care fees do not
apply.
E. Other physicians should then claim Critical Care fees or the appropriate consultation, visit or
procedures.
F. If the patient has been discharged from the Unit more than 48 hours and is re-admitted to the Unit,
the 1st day rate applies again on the day of re-admission.
G. The appropriate consultation, assessment and procedural benefits apply after stopping Critical
Care, Ventilatory Support, Comprehensive Care or Neonatal Intensive Care.
H. Unless otherwise stated, the Critical Care per diem fees should not be claimed for stabilized

CHRONIC DIALYSIS TEAM FEE
Chronic Dialysis Team Fee is the all-inclusive benefit per patient per week for professional aspects of
managing chronic dialysis and end-stage renal failure in dialysis patients. It is a modality independent
fee and is equal in monetary value whether the dialysis is delivered in hospital, community or home
and whether it is haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The team fee includes the services of all
physicians routinely or periodically participating in the patient's dialysis treatment at:
a. the patient's principal treatment centre; or
b. at a place other than the patient's principal treatment centre (auxiliary treatment centre)
where 3 or more dialysis treatments are rendered to the patient during the 7-day period
referred to below.
The amount payable is in respect of a 7-day period of care, commencing at midnight Sunday and is
payable to the most responsible physician.
Except as set out below, the amount payable to another physician in respect of these services
rendered to a patient in respect of whom a claim is submitted and paid for this code is nil.
When a full 7-day period of team care is not rendered at the patient's principal treatment centre due to
absence of the patient with treatment at an auxiliary treatment centre, the amount claimed for
treatment at the principal treatment centre is reduced on a pro rata basis to equal 1/7 of the weekly
fee for each day that the patient is the responsibility of the principal treatment centre.
In addition to the common elements of insured services and the specific elements of Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Procedures, the team fee includes the following elements:
A. All consultations and visits for management and supervision of chronic dialysis treatments
regardless of frequency, type or location of service and includes chronic dialysis of hospital in-
patients.
B. All consultations and visits within the scope of practice of nephrology and general internal medicine
for assessment and treatment of complications of chronic dialysis and management of end-stage
renal disease and its complications in chronic dialysis patients.
C. All related counselling, interviews, psychotherapy of patients and family members.
D. All related case conferences.
The team fee does not include:
A. Assessments and special visit premiums for emergent calls to the emergency department.
B. Admission assessments and subsequent visits to acute care hospital in-patients for treatment of
complications of dialysis, chronic renal disease or intercurrent illness.
C. Any other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, including acute dialysis treatments.
D. Consultations and assessments by specialists in other than internal medicine or internal medicine
sub-specialists other than nephrologists.
E. Primary care by the patient's family physician.
F. Assessment by a renal transplantation specialist for entry into a transplantation program.
G. Intermittent chronic haemodialysis treatment at an auxiliary treatment centre if fewer than three
dialysis treatments are rendered to the patient in the 7-day period referred to above.

service when rendered by an ophthalmologist. PDT must include completion and submission of
patient registration and drug requisition forms, establishment of intravenous access,
supervision of drug infusion and personal application of non-thermal diode laser for activation
of verteporfin.
PDT is insured only if the patient's clinical condition meets all of the following:
a. the patient has predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
secondary to either age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Presumed Ocular
Histoplasmosis Syndrome or pathologic myopia. Predominantly means that the area of
classic subfoveal CNV is equal to or greater than 50% of the total CNV lesion, as determined
by fluorescein angiography and documented by retinal photographs retained on the patient's

subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD, Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome or
pathologic myopia;
c. the patient's visual acuity is equal to or worse than 20/40; and
d. for each repeat therapy, recurrent or persistent CNV leakage is detected by fluorescein
angiography and documented by retinal photographs retained on the patient's permanent
medical record.
If the patient's clinical condition meets all the above criteria but retinal photographs are not
made prior to the procedure and retained on the patient's permanent medical record or the
procedure is not performed by an ophthalmologist, then PDT is not eligible for payment.
Maximum one PDT (unilateral or bilateral) per patient per day.

DIAGNOSTIC HEARING TEST
A.Diagnostic hearing tests (DHTs) are identified for payment purposes as either basic or advanced
DHTs.
B.Basic DHTs are insured services payable at nil unless:
1. the professional component is rendered personally by a physician qualified by appropriate
education or training and experience to perform basic DHTs (qualified physician); and
2. the technical component is either rendered by a qualified physician or delegated by a qualified
physician to a person who is either an appropriately qualified employee of the physician or is an
audiologist who is a member of the College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists
of Ontario and employed by a public hospital.
C.Advanced DHTs are insured services payable at nil unless:
1. the professional component is personally rendered by an otolaryngologist or, for evoked
audiometry, a neurologist or by a non-certified physician with equivalent post-graduate
academic training (appropriate specialist or equivalent); and
2. the technical component is personally rendered by an appropriate specialist or equivalent, or
delegated by an appropriate specialist or equivalent to an audiologist who is a member of the
College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists of Ontario and is employed by the
appropriate specialist or equivalent or a public hospital.
D.Physicians submitting claims for DHTs shall maintain written records of appropriate qualifications
as indicated above for themselves and those employees to whom they may delegate the technical
component. Such records must be made available to the ministry on request. In the absence of
such records, the DHT is an insured service payable at nil.
[Commentary:
1.Delegated DHT services - To qualify for payment, delegated DHT services must comply with
the requirements for delegation of insured services described in the General Preamble
GP62.
2.Interpretation of DHT services - To qualify for payment, the physician who claims the
professional component must personally interpret the DHT and cannot delegate the
interpretation to another person.
3.Controlled Acts - Communicating to the individual or his or her personal representative a
diagnosis identifying a disease or disorder as the cause of symptoms of the individual in
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that the individual or his or her personal
representative will rely on the diagnosis, or prescribing a hearing aid for a hearing impaired
person are controlled acts. If a physician interprets a diagnostic hearing test without
communicating the diagnosis to the patient or his or her personal representative, a controlled
act has not occurred.
4.Fixed level screening audiometry is not an insured service.
5.DHTs at the request of or arranged by third party, e.g. school boards, employers or WSIB etc.
are not insured services. See Appendix A regarding third party service.]

For the purpose of sleep studies (including overnight sleep studies in non-specialized facilities,
overnight sleep studies rendered in specialized facilities and daytime sleep studies),
“CPSO Standards” means the publication of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario
entitled “Independent Health Facilities, Clinical Practice Parameters and Facility Standards, Sleep
Medicine” in effect 6 months prior to the date upon which the sleep study was rendered.
“off-site premises” means off-site premises operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
“prior approval” means approved for payment as an insured service, before the service is rendered,
by the Ministry of Health following assessment on a case-by-case basis in accordance with all
medically relevant criteria.
[Commentary:
A “physician practicing sleep medicine” refers to a physician who meets the Medical Staff
requirements as defined in Chapter 2 of the “Independent Health Facilities, Clinical Practice
Parameters and Facility Standards, Sleep Medicine, September 2010 from the CPSO.]
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Sleep Studies are divided into a professional component listed in the columns headed with a "P", and
a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H" (the technical component).
The specific elements for the technical component H include the specific elements for the technical
component of non-invasive diagnostic procedures listed in the Preamble to Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Procedures.
If the physician is physically present during the study, the physician’s physical presence is a specific
element of the technical and professional components.
OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
For services rendered outside a hospital or off-site premises, the only fees payable under the Health
Insurance Act are for the professional component listed under the “P” column (use suffix C). Costs for
the technical component of these services are only payable under the Integrated Community Health
Services Centres Act, 2023 and are listed in the Schedule of Facility Costs.
Sleep studies are subject to limits or maximums set out below. Unless otherwise specifically provided,
service(s) in excess of limits are not insured services except when prior approval to exceed the limit is
obtained from the MOH. Despite the foregoing, where prior approval to exceed a limit is not requested
from the MOH but the service would otherwise satisfy one or more of the conditions for which prior
approval to exceed the limit is routinely granted (had prior approval been requested) any service in
excess of the limit is not eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
For definitions of maximum and limits see GP7.]
Claims submission instructions:
Submit claims for professional and technical components separately. Submit claims for the
technical component H using listed fee code with suffix B. Submit claims for professional

preceding study was rendered (the “first facility”), neither the owner nor the operator of
the different facility is, at the time the repeat study is rendered, an associate of the
owner or operator of the first facility, where “associate” has the same meaning as in the
Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023; or
b. for one or more of the following purposes, after pre-study assessment by a physician
practicing sleep medicine:
i. re-evaluation of a previous negative or inconclusive diagnostic sleep study as indicated
by persistent or progressive symptoms;
ii. re-evaluation, other than primarily for Positive Airway Pressure therapy (PAP)
adjustment, of patients previously diagnosed with a primary sleep disorder in which
there has been symptom development suggesting another co-morbid sleep disorder; or
iii. re-evaluation of patients with an established diagnosis of a sleep disorder other than a
sleep related breathing disorder who have significant symptom progression or non-
response to therapy.
[Commentary:
1.In the case of patients with previously diagnosed sleep related breathing disorders, although
PAP treatment may be adjusted during a repeat study, a repeat study is not eligible for
payment if rendered primarily for PAP treatment adjustment.

Therapeutic study for sleep related breathing disorders - Level 1
J895 - therapeutic study................................................................ 370.75 97.50
Payment rules:
1. There is a limit of one therapeutic study per patient during any two consecutive 12 month
periods except where prior approval has been given.
2. J895 rendered to the same patient during the same 12 - hour period as J896 or J897 is not
eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
Subject to the prior approval requirements, an additional therapeutic study in excess of the
above limits may be payable when necessary to evaluate a change in the treatment modality
for a sleep related breathing disorder.]
Note:
1.For payment purposes, repeat diagnostic studies or therapeutic studies for indications or in
circumstances other than listed above, or in excess of the limits set out above require prior
approval.
2.A repeat diagnostic study rendered without the required pre-study assessment by a
physician practicing sleep medicine, is not eligible for payment.
3.A therapeutic study rendered without a pre-study assessment by a physician practicing sleep
medicine is not eligible for payment except:
a.For the therapeutic study that immediately follows an initial diagnostic or repeat
diagnostic study where:
i. the time interval is such that it is unlikely the clinical circumstances of the patient has
changed; and
ii. the physician practicing sleep medicine has previously assessed the patient and
documented the applicable decisions with respect to the performance of the
therapeutic study; or
b.In exceptional circumstances where the physician can demonstrate to the ministry upon
request that the CPSO standards are satisfied with the use of a clinical protocol or
approved medical directive.
[Commentary:
1.An example of an exceptional circumstance may be where a patient is required to travel a
long distance to a sleep facility and requires an initial diagnostic or repeat diagnostic study
followed by a therapeutic study on a subsequent night. For payment purposes, a pre-study
assessment by a physician practicing sleep medicine is not required provided the therapeutic
study is rendered in accordance with a clinical protocol or medical directive that has been
approved by an authority other than a physician affiliated with the sleep facility (e.g. a
Medical Advisory Committee for a sleep clinic affiliated with a hospital). The physician should
be prepared to provide any necessary supporting documentation to the ministry upon
request.
2.Prior approval, where required, will typically be dependent on the physician demonstrating
that the study is generally accepted as necessary for the patient under the circumstances.
3.Sleep studies that require prior approval also require a pre-study assessment by a physician
practicing sleep medicine. It is this assessment upon which the request for prior approval is
considered.

SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
In addition to the common elements, most obstetrical services have the same specific elements as
other services listed elsewhere in the Schedule.
Obstetrical Care includes the following kinds of services:
a. Prenatal visits (major or minor or high risk) and postnatal care in the office are assessments
(see General Preamble GP21).
b. Labour-Delivery services have the specific elements of IOP Surgical Procedures identified
with prefix # (see Surgical Preamble SP1).
c. Anaesthetic services have the same specific elements as other services provided by an
anaesthesiologist (see General Preamble GP92).
d. Postnatal care in hospital/home (P007) is the initial assessment of a well patient postpartum
with subsequent assessments of the well patient in the hospital or home until the patient’s
first visit to the physician’s office. The specific elements for each visit are those for
assessments (see General Preamble GP21).
e. Attendance at labour is a service of being in constant or periodic attendance on a patient,
during stages one and two of labour but without completion of the delivery, to provide all
aspects of care. This includes the initial assessment, and such subsequent assessments as
may be indicated, including ongoing monitoring of the patient’s conditions, intervening
except where intervention is a separately billable service. The specific elements are those of
assessments (see General Preamble GP21) except element H, but include providing
premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for any aspects of the specific elements of the
service that are performed outside the place in which the encounter(s) with the patient
occurs.
f. Attendance at delivery, specific elements as for Surgical Assistants’ Services (see General
Preamble GP85).
For all other procedures listed in this section the specific elements are those of IOP surgical
procedures identified with prefix # (see Surgical Preamble SP1) except for removal of Shirodkar
suture for which the specific elements are those for surgical IOP procedures not identified with prefix
#.
Fee schedule codes listed below which do not include providing all premises, equipment and
personnel used to perform the specific elements of the service are identified with prefix #.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. A prenatal major assessment includes a full history, and an examination of all parts or systems
(and may include a detailed examination of one or more parts or systems), an appropriate
record and advice to the patient. All other prenatal visits include the necessary history,
examination, appropriate record and advice to the patient. All prenatal visits (major and minor
and high risk) include pregnancy-related counselling as a form of providing advice to the patient
or the patient’s representative.
A prenatal general assessment is payable after another general assessment only if the reason
for the first assessment does not pertain to the establishment of the antenatal care.
Normal (uncomplicated) prenatal care includes a prenatal general assessment visit, then
monthly visits to 28 weeks, followed by visits every 2nd week to 36 weeks, then weekly visits
until delivery. However, complicated pregnancies may require additional visits. Labour, delivery
and postpartum care are listed separately.
2. If an uncomplicated obstetrical patient is transferred from one physician to another physician for
obstetrical care, the appropriate assessment benefit may be claimed by the second physician,
followed by prenatal visits. This statement does not apply to physicians substituting for each
other or when the second physician sees the patient for the first time in labour. If the obstetrical
patient is referred to a consultant for obstetrical care because of the complexity, obscurity or
seriousness of the case, the consultant may claim a consultation in addition to the prenatal
visits.
3. Illnesses resulting from or associated with pregnancy or false labour requiring added home or
hospital visits, shall be claimed on a per visit basis.
4. When a pregnant patient visits her physician for a condition unrelated to her pregnancy and
apart from her routine scheduled prenatal visits, the physician may claim the appropriate
assessment.
5. Fee schedule codes in this section are subject to the provisions of the Surgical Preamble where
applicable.
6. An assessment is payable for illness resulting from, or associated with, pregnancy or false
labour even if the patient progresses to delivery within the next two days. This does not apply to
patients who are assessed in the first stage of labour and admitted, or are transferred, to the
delivery room from the antenatal floor in labour.
7. The listings under the heading Referred Services may be claimed by the consultant physician in
addition to the appropriate consultation or visit fee. They may not be claimed by physicians
providing obstetrical care to their own patients.
8. If a consultant is requested by another physician to perform a surgical induction of labour, or
emergency removal of a Shirodkar suture (except at delivery) assuming someone else has
inserted the suture, the consultant should claim a consultation fee for this(these) service(s).
9. Medical induction or stimulation of labour may be claimed once per pregnancy by any one
physician and only when carried out for a recognized obstetrical complication(s). The fee listed
is applicable regardless of the time spent by the physician, therefore, detention may not be
claimed.

10.The listings for “Attendance at labour and delivery” and for “Attendance of obstetric
consultant(s) at delivery” may not be claimed by any physician when a patient is transferred to a
second physician for normal obstetrical care.
11. Ordinary immediate care of the newborn is included in the labour-delivery fee and when the
service is rendered by the anaesthetist, it is included in the anaesthetic benefit. A life
threatening emergency situation requiring active resuscitation of the newborn provided by any
physician may be claimed under codes G521, G522, G523. When indicated, endotracheal
intubation and tracheo-bronchial toilet should be billed under G211 and not as G521, G522,
G523.
12.When an obstetrician routinely transfers all newborns to another physician, the latter may not
claim a consultation for these transferals. If the baby is well, the physician should claim newborn
care in hospital plus attendance at maternal delivery (H007/H267) if this service is provided. If
the baby is sick, the physician may claim a general assessment and attendance at maternal
delivery (H007/H267) if this service is provided plus daily visits for as long as his/her services
are required.
13.If an obstetrician who normally cares for newborns him/herself or transfers the care of newborns
to a family physician, refers a newborn to a paediatrician because of the complexity, obscurity or
seriousness of the case, the latter may claim for this service according to the following
guidelines:
a. If attendance at maternal delivery is provided, C263 may be claimed in addition to H267 if a
general assessment of the baby is carried out. A postnatal consultation of the baby, (C265)
may not be claimed in addition to attendance at maternal delivery (H267).
b. If attendance at maternal delivery (H267) is not provided, a postnatal consultation (C265)
may be claimed, if rendered, whether or not a prenatal consultation has already been
claimed.
14.Physicians may claim for assisted breech delivery (P020) when the service includes
spontaneous delivery to the umbilicus, with extraction of the shoulders, arms and head.
15.See General Preamble GP104 for After Hours Premiums.
16.If claims are being submitted in coded form, the obstetrician should add the suffix “A” to the
listed procedural code, the assistant should add the suffix “B” to the listed procedural code, and
the anaesthetist should add the suffix “C” to the listed procedural code.
