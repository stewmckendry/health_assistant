ORTHOPAEDIC TUMOUR SURGERY
R226 Biopsy of suspected sarcoma, or resection of a complex bone
or complex soft tissue tumour(s), per 15 minutes .............. 10 100.00 15
Payment rules:
1.R226 is eligible for payment only to an oncological orthopaedic surgeon with fellowship
training in orthopaedic oncology. Documentation of fellowship training must be provided to
the ministry prior to submitting a claim for R226.
[Commentary:
Surgeons eligible to claim R226 will typically be working within a multidisciplinary sarcoma
subspecialty group.]
2.R226 is a time based service. Except when rendering the services of a surgical assistant,
time calculation for the purpose of R226A includes all resection and reconstruction
components of the procedure rendered by the physician claiming R226A.
[Commentary:
For any period of time that a surgeon claiming R226A renders the services of an assistant, the
time spent assisting constitutes surgical assist time and is not eligible for payment as time for
the purpose of R226A.]
3.Biopsy of suspected sarcoma, or resection of a complex bone or complex soft tissue
tumour(s) is not eligible for payment as R226 when rendered in conjunction with another
procedure(s) by the same surgeon when the biopsy or tumour resection is not the major
procedure.
[Commentary:
In these circumstances (payment rule 3), use the appropriate fee code listing in the Schedule
under biopsy or excision of bone or soft tissue.]
4.R226 is eligible for payment for complex tumour resection by amputation only when the
tumour resected is malignant.
[Commentary:
For other tumour resection by amputation, use the appropriate fee code listing in the Schedule
under amputation.]
5.If the nature, complexity and/or length of the procedure require(s) two oncological
orthopaedic surgeons to render components of the same procedure simultaneously or
sequentially, R226A is eligible for payment to each surgeon.
Claims submission instructions:
Submit R226A claims for a second surgeon using the manual review indicator and
accompanied by operative report.
[Commentary:
In accordance with the Surgical Preamble, if a surgeon who is not an oncological orthopaedic
surgeon renders a specialized component of the procedure (eg reconstructive flaps or grafts),
the surgeon should claim the appropriate fee code(s) from the Schedule for the service(s)
rendered.]

6.Time calculation commences when the surgeon begins the procedure and ends when the
surgeon leaves the operating room.
7.Time unit calculation is based on full 15 minute time units.
Medical record requirements:
This service is eligible for payment only if start and stop times of the service are recorded in the
patient's permanent medical record.
[Commentary:
Any surgeon rendering R226A should also record in the patient's permanent medical record the
start and stop times of surgical assistant services when rendered.]
