X400 - without IV contrast.............................................................. - 43.25

E874 - with CT perfusion study, to X188, X400, X401, X402,
X405, or X408............................................................ add 64.00
Note:
1.E874 is only eligible for payment when the study is rendered as part of the investigation of
acute stroke and the interpretation is rendered within the limited period of time following
acute stroke during which the treating physician must render therapeutic decisions.
2.E874 includes the administration of contrast necessary to complete the CT perfusion study.
3.E874 includes creation and interpretation of post-imaging colour mapping of cerebral
perfusion maps for regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean blood
transit time.
[Commentary:
For example, when a CT perfusion study is only performed in conjunction with a non-contrast
CT head scan, the appropriate claim is E874 and the non-contrast CT head service (e.g. X400,
X402). In this example, a claim for E874 with a contrast enhanced CT head service (e.g. X401,
X405) would not be appropriate.]

Cardio-thoracic
Cardio-thoracic CT is an imaging service of the cardio-thoracic structures including cardiac
gating and 3D imaging post-processing, cardiac structure and morphology and computed
tomographic angiography of coronary arteries (including native and anomalous coronary
arteries, coronary bypass grafts) and requires imaging without contrast material followed by
contrast material(s).
X235 Cardio-thoracic ...................................................................... - 147.50
Note:
1.The service described by X235 includes the supervision of oral beta blockers and/or IV
injection where clinically indicated.
2.X235 is only eligible for payment when the service is performed using a minimum of a
64-detector CT scanner.
3.X235 is only eligible for payment when:
a.one or more of the following indications are present:
i. arterial and venous aneurysms;
ii. traumatic injuries of arteries and veins;
iii. arterial dissection and intramural hematoma;
iv. arterial thromboembolism;
v. vascular congenital anomalies and variants;
vi. percutaneous and surgical, vascular interventions;
vii.vascular infection, vasculitis, and collagen vascular disease;
viii.sequelae of ischemic coronary disease (i.e. myocardial scarring, ventricular
aneurysms, thrombi);
ix. cardiac tumours and thrombi;
x. pericardial diseases;
xi. cardiac function evaluation, especially in patients in whom cardiac function may not
be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or echocardiography; or
b.conventional coronary angiography is technically infeasible, or contraindicated for:
i. a clinically stable symptomatic patient with low to intermediate probability of
obstructive coronary disease;
ii. a clinically stable symptomatic patient who has planned surgery for valvular or
structural heart disease;
iii. a patient has low to intermediate probability of stent stenosis where the stent has a
diameter > 3mm; or
iv. a patient with suspected clinically relevant congenital coronary artery anomalies.
Payment rules:
1.X417, X406, X407, and X125 are not eligible for payment with X235.
2.X235 includes all elements required to perform the study, including additional CT acquisition
sequencing and/or post-processing, two or three dimensional reconstruction(s), and
administration of contrast.

Medical record requirements:
X235 is only eligible for payment when the patient’s permanent medical record includes all of
the following:
1.An interpretation is provided by a physician who must meet the current American College of
Radiology’s minimum training standards for thorax and cardiac CT imaging.
2.A record of a detailed relevant patient history and demographics to determine the scan
protocol is maintained.
3.A diagnosis of the entire detailed field of view is provided including the lymph nodes, pleura,
lungs, mediastinum, airways, bony thorax, spine and heart, and veins, arteries and other
related anatomical structure.
4.A quantitative evaluation of coronary calcium for risk stratification is documented when
clinically appropriate.

[Commentary:
1.For services where the heart vasculature and structures are not being visualized for the
indications above, CT thorax (X406, X407 and/or X125) may be payable instead of X235.
2.Examples where CT coronary angiography is not insured include:
a.for a patient with a high pre-test probability of obstructive coronary artery disease or ECG
or cardiac enzyme evidence of an acute coronary syndrome;
b.for purposes of screening, risk stratification, or calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients.
3.The maintenance of radiation dose should be consistent with the As Low As Responsibly
Achievable principle and current standards under the direction of the radiologist Radiation
Protection Officer.]

2.X417, X409, X410, X126, X231, X232, X233 are not eligible for payment with X234.
Payment rules:
1.CT colonography is an insured service only in the following circumstances:
a.individuals who are at moderate risk for colorectal cancer based on family history and the
patient refuses colonoscopy or where the patient has been advised of the relative risks
and benefits of CT colonography and colonoscopy and the patient refuses colonoscopy;
b.for surveillance examination in patients with a history of previous colonic neoplasm,
where clinically appropriate;
c.for diagnostic examination in symptomatic patients;
[Commentary:
Examples of relevant symptomatology include unexplained abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, intestinal obstruction, or weight loss.]
1.when rendered for a patient for whom colonoscopy is technically infeasible, has been difficult
in the past, or contraindicated;
2.for patients who are at increased risk for complications during endoscopy such as, advanced
age, sedation or anti-coagulation therapy, prior incomplete or difficult colonoscopy;
3.when double contrast barium enema services are unavailable or regarded as inadequate for
clinical or diagnostic reasons.]
