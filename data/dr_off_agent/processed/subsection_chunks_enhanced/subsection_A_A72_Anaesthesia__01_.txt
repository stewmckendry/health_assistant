SPECIAL ANAESTHETIC CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A special anaesthetic consultation is rendered when an anaesthesia (01) specialist provides all
the appropriate elements of a regular consultation and is required to devote at least fifty (50)
minutes of direct contact with the patient exclusive of time spent rendering any other separately
billable intervention to the patient.
A210 Special anaesthetic consultation ............................................ 163.20
Limited consultation for acute pain management
A limited consultation for acute pain management is a consultation which takes place when a
physician is requested by another physician to see a hospital in-patient because of the
complexity or severity of the acute pain condition.
A215 Limited consultation for acute pain management in association
with special visit to hospital in-patient ................................ 69.75
Payment rules:
1.The routine pre-anaesthetic evaluation of the patient required by Reg 965 of the Public
Hospitals Act does not constitute a consultation, regardless of where and when this
evaluation is performed.
2.For A210 the start and stop time of the service must be recorded in the patient’s permanent
medical record
3.A215 is not eligible for payment:
a.with P014C - introduction of catheter for labour analgesia, including the first dose of
medication with or without any combined spinal-epidural injection(s);
b.for management of routine post-operative pain; or
c.for referrals from another anaesthesiologist.
[Commentary:
1.The general anaesthesia service includes a pre-anaesthetic evaluation, with specific
elements as for assessments (see GP15) which does not constitute a consultation
2.P014C - is an anaesthesia service, therefore the pre-anaesthetic evaluation is included in the
service and is not payable as a limited consultation for acute pain management or as any
other consultation or assessment.]
