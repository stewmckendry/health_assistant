PREAMBLE
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Pulmonary Function diagnostic procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the
columns headed with a "P", and a technical component listed in the columns headed with an "H" or a
"T". The technical component "H" of the procedures subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic
Services Rendered at a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
The technical component "T" of the procedure is eligible for payment for services rendered in a
physician's office or a hospital with the latter subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic
Services Rendered at a Hospital" and “Payment for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Services Rendered at
a Hospital” on page GP11.
In addition to the common elements, the components of Pulmonary Function diagnostic procedures
include the following specific elements.
For Professional Component P
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate, and quality control of all elements of the technical component
of the procedure.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is(are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B and C,
these may be delegated to another physician, who must personally perform the service.
Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
For Technical Component H and T
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s representative,
whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretive report of the procedure to the
referring provider.

G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect(s) of A and D of the
professional component that is(are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is
performed.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for technical component
H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional component P are
submitted using listed fee code with suffix C.
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting (except for J301, J304, J324, and J327) the
only fees billable under the Health Insurance Act are listed under the column P (use suffix C).
Costs for the technical component of services rendered in an ICHSC are listed in the Schedule
of Facility Costs.
3. Each of the following tests designated by an individual code number is considered to be specific
and requires individual ordering.
4. Exercise assessment (J315, E450, E451, J316) requires a physician to be in attendance at all
times.
5. The technical and professional fee components for pulmonary function studies are not eligible
for payment in the routine preoperative preparation or screening of a patient for non-thoracic
surgery unless required for respiratory diagnosis, anesthetic decision making or optimization of
a patient's respiratory disease prior to surgery.

is not eligible for payment.
3.J301 and J324 must be performed with a permanent record including a written interpretation
by the physician or the study is not eligible for payment.
4.J304 and J327 are only eligible for payment for a study that meets all of the following
requirements:
a.There is a permanent record that includes a written interpretation by the physician;
b. The permanent record includes constituent graph(s), tracing(s) and measurements with a
scale on the tracing or graph of:
i. at least 5 mm per litre per second for flow; and
ii. 10 mm per litre for volume.
c.The technical component of the study complies with the CPSO Clinical Practice
Parameters and Facility Standards for Diagnostic Spirometry and Flow Volume Loop
