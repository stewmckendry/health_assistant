GENERAL PREAMBLE
General PreambleMarch 4, 2024 (effective April 1, 2024)
INTRODUCTION
[Commentary:
The Health Insurance Act and, to a lesser extent, the Integrated Community Health Services
Centres Act, 2023 and the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004, provide the legal
foundation and framework for the Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services (“the Schedule”).
The Schedule lists services insured by OHIP and includes the General Preamble (which
impacts all physicians), Consultations and Visits section (which applies to all specialties) and
specific system and/or specialty sections (including specialty preambles).
The General Preamble provides details about billing requirements for all physicians as follows:
The initial Definitions Section (GP2) begins with general definitions of key terms and phrases
used in the Schedule. Those terms and phrases are italicized throughout the General Preamble
as an indication that further information is available in the Definitions Section. The second
group of defined terms refers specifically to maximums, minimums, and time or unit-based
services.
The information provided in the General Information Section (GP8) is the foundation for the
remainder of the General Preamble. A variety of subjects are reviewed as detailed in the table
of contents. This is followed by the Constituent and Common Elements of Insured Services
(GP13). Next is the section which lists the Specific Elements of Assessments (GP15). The
next section provides information on Consultations and Assessments (GP16) followed by
the section regarding services provided only in Hospitals and Other Institutions (GP40).
The next section focuses on psychotherapy, counselling, and related services, followed by a
similar review of services that involve interviews. The remaining sections include special visits,
surgical assistants’ services, anaesthesiologists’ services, and others as listed in the table of
contents.]
