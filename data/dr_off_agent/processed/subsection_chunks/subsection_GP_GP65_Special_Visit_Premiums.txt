SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
Special visit means a visit initiated by a patient or an individual on behalf of the patient for the purpose
of rendering a non-elective service or, if rendered in the patient's home, a non-elective or elective
service.
A special visit premium is payable in respect of a special visit rendered to an insured person, subject
to the conditions and limitations set out below. All special visit premiums are subject to the maximums,
limitations and conditions set out in the "Special Visit Premium Table" applicable in the circumstances.
Payment rules:
1.Special visit premiums are only eligible for payment when rendered with certain services
listed under "Consultations and Visits" and "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures"
sections of this Schedule.
2.Regardless of the time of day at which the service is rendered, special visit premiums are not
eligible for payment in the following circumstances:
a.for patients seen during rounds at a hospital or long-term care institution (including a
nursing home or home for the aged);
b.in conjunction with admission assessments of patients who have been admitted to
hospital on an elective basis;
c.for non-referred or transferred obstetrical patients except, in the case of transferred
obstetrical patients for a special visit for obstetrical delivery with sacrifice of office hours
for the first patient seen (C989);
d.for services rendered in a place, other than a hospital or long-term care facility, that is
scheduled to be open for the purpose of diagnosing or treating patients;
e.for a visit for which critical care team fees are payable under this Schedule;
f. in conjunction with any sleep study service listed in the sleep studies section of this
Schedule; or
g.for services rendered to patients who present to an office without an appointment while
the physician is there, or for patients seen immediately before, during or immediately after
routine or ordinary office hours even if held at night or on weekends or holidays.
3.Special visit premiums are not eligible for payment with services described by emergency
department "H" prefix fee codes.
[Commentary:
For elective home visits rendered during daytime, evenings, nights or weekends, submit
claim(s) using fee codes found under the column titled "Elective Home Visit" of Special Visit
Premium Table VI listed on page GP75.]
Sacrifice of office hours means an insured service rendered when the demands of the patient and/or
the patient's condition are such that the physician makes a previously unscheduled non-elective visit
to the patient at a time when the physician had an office visit booked with one or more patients but,
because of the previously unscheduled non-elective visit, any such office visit was delayed or
cancelled.

SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
PREMIUMS
[Commentary:
Special visit premiums are in respect of either or both: a "travel premium" and a "patient seen"
premium (i.e. "first person seen premium" or "an additional person seen premium").]
A. Travel Premium
Definition/required elements of service:
A travel premium is only eligible for payment for travel from one location to another location ("the
destination") subject to the payment rules below.
A travel premium is not eligible for payment when a physician is required to travel from one location to
another within the same long-term care facility, hospital complex or within buildings situated on the
same hospital campus.
[Commentary:
1.A first person seen premium may be eligible for payment in this circumstance.
2.Only one travel premium is eligible for payment for each separate trip to a destination
regardless of the number of patients seen in association with each trip.]
B. First person seen premium
A first person seen premium is eligible for payment for the first person seen at the destination under
one of the following circumstances ("the eligible times"):
1. if the insured service is commenced evenings (17:00 hr-24:00 hr) Monday to Friday; daytime or
evenings on Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays; or nights (24:00 hr-07:00 hr);
2. if rendered requiring sacrifice of office hours; or
3. if rendered during daytime hours (07:00 - 17:00 hrs Monday through Friday) in circumstances in
which a travel premium is eligible for payment.
C. Additional person premium
An additional person premium is only eligible for payment for services rendered at the destination to
additional patients seen in emergency departments, outpatient departments, long-term care
institutions or to hospital inpatients, provided that each additional patient service is commenced
during the eligible times.
[Commentary:
Special visit premiums are not eligible for payment for elective services rendered at a long-term
care institution, including a nursing home or home for the aged, even when the long-term care
institution is the "home" of the patient.
Submit claims for routine elective visits in these locations as subsequent visits. For example, if
the physician is called to a nursing home to see a patient for a non-elective problem at 8AM,
and subsequently sees his/her routine patients on rounds, those additional patients do not
qualify for the additional person premium.]

SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
LIMITS FOR SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
Special visit premiums in excess of the maximums listed in the Special Visit Premium Tables are not
eligible for payment.
The maximums apply to the number of patients where special visit premiums may be eligible for
payment on that service date or in the time period specified.
LIMITS FOR GERIATRIC HOME VISIT SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
For the purpose of special visit premiums under the heading "Geriatric Home Visit Special Visit
Premiums", the special visit premiums listed under Table X are only eligible for payment to:
a. a specialist in Geriatrics (07); or
b. a physician with an exemption to access bonus impact in Care of the Elderly from the MOH.

specifically for the purpose of rendering services to patients who attend the emergency
department for physician services,
i. is requested by the emergency department to attend at a time when the physician is not
otherwise scheduled to work in the emergency department; and
ii. who is not at the hospital at the time the emergency department request for attendance
is made; or
b. is on-call on a scheduled basis specifically to be available to a hospital emergency
department to render services to patients who attend the emergency department for
physician services and who is not at the hospital at the time the emergency department
request for attendance is made.
[Commentary:
Emergency room physicians may be primarily funded either through an Emergency
Department Alternate Funding Arrangement (ED-AFA) or fee-for-service.]
In addition to the general restrictions regarding special visits as outlined above, there are specific
restrictions which apply to special visit premiums for services rendered in the emergency department
by Emergency Department Physicians (as defined above). These limits are listed in the Special Visit
Premiums table under the heading “Emergency Department by Emergency Department Physician”
(Table V). Special Visit Premiums listed in the Special Visit Premiums table under the heading
"Emergency Department" (Table I) are not eligible for payment to Emergency Department Physicians
(as defined above).
[Commentary:
1.First patient seen and additional person seen premiums for Emergency Department
Physicians are eligible for payment only when the physician is required to travel, as defined
under “Travel Premium” page GP66, to make a special visit to the hospital emergency
department.

2.If the Emergency Department Physician is at the hospital at the time the emergency
department request for attendance is made, the appropriate H prefix code may be eligible for
payment.
3.If the Emergency Department Physician is called to a hospital ward on a non-elective basis,
the General Listings ("A" prefix) apply and "C" prefix first person seen/additional person seen
special visit premium may be eligible for payment.]
Note:
When special visits are rendered by physicians when they are not on duty to the emergency
department, the limits for special visit premiums under the heading "Emergency Department"
(Table I) apply (GP70). For patients assessed during this visit to the emergency department
beyond the defined limits, submit claims for all subsequent patients using the "H" prefix listings.
