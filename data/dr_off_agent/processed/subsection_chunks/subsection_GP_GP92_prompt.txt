b. the anaesthetic procedure; and
c. post-anaesthetic follow-up.
Note:
1.With the exception of the listings in the “Consultations and Visits” section, all references to an

Schedule, includes all forms of anaesthesia except local infiltration, unless otherwise
specifically listed.
CALCULATION OF FEE PAYABLE – BASIC AND TIME UNITS
The amount payable for the anaesthesia service is calculated by adding the number of basic and time
units and multiplying the total by the anaesthesiologist unit fee.
Anaesthesiologist Unit fee .................................................. $15.49
Basic Units: The number of basic units is the number of basic units listed opposite the service in the
column headed with “Anae” except,

GENERAL PREAMBLE
ANAESTHESIOLOGISTS’ SERVICES
a. where multiple or bilateral surgical procedures are performed during the same anaesthetic,
the number of basic units listed in the column headed with “Anae” opposite the service that
describes the major procedure; or
b. where the basic units are listed as IC, or where no basic units are listed, the amount payable
is calculated by adding the appropriate time units to the basic units listed for a comparable
procedure (taking into account the region, modifying conditions, or techniques).
Time Units: Time units are calculated on the basis of time spent by the anaesthesiologist and
commence when the anaesthesiologist is first in attendance with the patient in the OR for the purpose
of initiating anaesthesia and end when the anaesthesiologist is no longer in attendance (when the
patient may safely be placed under customary post-operative supervision). Time units are calculated
for each 15 minutes or part thereof. The unit value of each 15 minute period or part thereof is:
During the first hour ................................................................ 1 unit
After the first hour up to and including the first 1.5 hours ....... 2 units
After 1.5 hours ........................................................................ 3 units
Claims submission instruction:
Submit claims for anaesthesia services rendered with a surgical procedure using the suffix “C”, with
the procedural code.
[Commentary:
see Appendix H for a table stating the duration of the anaesthesia service and corresponding
time units.]

ANAESTHESIOLOGISTS’ SERVICES
CANCELLED SURGERY - ANAESTHESIA SERVICES
Payment rules:
1. If an anaesthesiologist examines a patient prior to surgery and the surgery is cancelled prior to
the induction of anaesthesia, the service rendered constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.
2. When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled prior to commencement of
surgery, the service constitutes E006C with the actual number of time units added to 6 basic
units for this service.
[Commentary:
If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced, the amount payable is calculated by
adding the listed procedural basic units plus time units and multiplying the total by the unit fee.]
SECOND ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
Unless otherwise specified in the Schedule, when the anaesthetic services of more than one
anaesthesiologist are necessary in the interest of the patient, the service provided by the second
anaesthesiologist constitutes E001C with the actual number of time units (based on the actual time
assisting the first anaesthesiologist) added to 6 basic units.
REPLACEMENT ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
When one anaesthesiologist starts a procedure and is replaced by another anaesthesiologist (“the
replacement anaesthesiologist”) during a surgical procedure or delivery:
a. the amount payable to the first anaesthesiologist is calculated by adding the listed
procedural basic units plus time units for the time the first anaesthesiologist is in attendance;
b. except in the case of continuous conduction anaesthesia, the service provided by the
replacement anaesthesiologist constitutes E005C based on the actual number of time units
and 6 basic units.
Note:
E005C qualifies for the premiums E400C or E401C only if the case commences after hours
(see GP94).
[Commentary:
1.Each anaesthesiologist must indicate, as part of the medical record, his/her starting and
finishing times.
2.For continuous conduction anaesthesia, the replacement anaesthesiologist submits claims
using the applicable continuous conduction anaesthesia fee code.]
OBSTETRICS – CONTINUOUS CONDUCTION ANAESTHESIA
P014C, introduction of a catheter for labour analgesia, including the first dose of medication with or
without any combined spinal-epidural injection(s), has a value of 7 basic units.
P016C time units for maintenance of obstetrical epidural anaesthesia are calculated on the basis of 1
unit for each ½ hour of time to a maximum of 12 units.
E100C time units for attendance at delivery are calculated on the basis of 4 base units and 1 unit for
each ¼ hour
