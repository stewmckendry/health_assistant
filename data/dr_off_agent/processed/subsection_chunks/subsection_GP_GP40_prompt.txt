GENERAL PREAMBLE
HOSPITAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSULTATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS
ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL – NON-EMERGENCY IN-PATIENT SERVICES (“C” PREFIX
SERVICES)
A. Admission Assessment – General Requirements
Definition:
a. An admission assessment is the initial assessment of the patient rendered for the purpose
of admitting a patient to hospital.
b. The admitting physician is the physician who renders the admission assessment.
Payment rules:
1. Except as outlined below in paragraph 3, when the admitting physician has not previously
assessed the patient for the same presenting illness within 90 days of the admission
assessment, the admission assessment constitutes a consultation, general or medical specific
or specific assessment depending on the specialty of the physician, the nature of the service
rendered and any applicable payment rules.
2. Except as outlined below in paragraph 3, if the admitting physician has previously assessed the
patient for the same presenting illness within 90 days of the admission assessment, the
admission assessment constitutes a general re-assessment or specific re-assessment
depending on the specialty of the physician, the nature of the service rendered and any
applicable payment rules.
3. When a hospital in-patient is transferred from one physician to another physician, only one
consultation, general or specific assessment or reassessment is eligible for payment
per patient admission. The amount eligible for payment for services in excess of this limit will be
adjusted to a lesser assessment fee. An additional admission assessment is not eligible for
payment when a hospital inpatient is transferred from one physician to another physician within
the same hospital.
Admission Assessments by Specialists:
When a patient has been assessed by a specialist in the emergency room (ER) or out-patient
department (OPD) and that physician renders a service described as a consultation, specific
assessment, or medical specific assessment and subsequently admits the patient to hospital, the
initial consultation, specific, or medical specific assessment constitutes the admission assessment.
When a patient has been assessed by a specialist in the ER or OPD, and that physician renders any
other assessment other than those listed in the paragraph immediately above, and that physician
subsequently admits the patient to hospital, an admission assessment is eligible for payment in
addition to the initial assessment, if each service is rendered separately.
[Commentary:
In accordance with the surgical preamble, a hospital admission assessment by the surgeon is
not eligible for payment, unless it is the “major pre-operative visit” (i.e., the consultation or
assessment which may be claimed when the decision to operate is made and the operation is
scheduled).]

HOSPITAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSULTATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS
Admission Assessments by General and Family Practitioners:
When a patient has been assessed by a general or family practitioner in the emergency room (ER) or
out-patient department (OPD) and that physician renders a service described as a consultation,
general assessment, or general re-assessment and subsequently admits the patient to hospital, the
initial consultation, general assessment, general re-assessment constitutes the admission
assessment.
When a patient has been assessed by a general or family practitioner in the ER or OPD and that
physician renders any other assessment other than those listed in the paragraph immediately above,
and subsequently admits the patient to hospital, an admission assessment is eligible for payment in
addition to the initial assessment, if each assessment is rendered separately.
Payment rules:
A933/C933/C003/C004 are not eligible for payment for an admission assessment for an elective
surgery patient when a pre-operative assessment has been rendered to the same patient within 30
days of admission by the same physician.
Admission Assessments by General and Family Practitioners in an Emergency
Department Funded under an Emergency Department Alternative Funding Agreement:
When a patient has been assessed by the patient's general or family practitioner in an emergency
room and that physician subsequently admits the patient to hospital, the General/Family Physician
Emergency Department Assessment constitutes the admission assessment if the physician remains
the most responsible physician for the patient.

GENERAL PREAMBLE
HOSPITAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSULTATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS
Admission Assessments by Emergency Physicians:
When a patient has been assessed by an emergency physician in the ER or OPD and that physician
renders a service described as a consultation, general assessment, or general re-assessment and
subsequently admits the patient to hospital as the most responsible physician or that physician is
asked to perform the admission assessment (even though the patient is admitted under a different
most responsible physician), the initial consultation, general assessment, or general re-assessment
constitutes the admission assessment.
When a patient has been assessed by an emergency physician in the ER or OPD and that physician
renders any other assessment other than those listed in the paragraph immediately above, and
subsequently renders the admission assessment, (even if the patient is admitted under a different
most responsible physician), the admission assessment is payable as C004, in addition to the initial
assessment, if both services are rendered separately.
Admission Assessment by the Most Responsible Physician (MRP) Premium
E082 Admission assessment by the MRP, to admission
assessment .......................................................... add 30%
Payment rules:
1.E082 is only eligible for payment once per patient per hospital admission.
2.E082 is only eligible for payment:
a.if the physician establishes that he or she does not receive any direct or indirect
remuneration from a hospital or hospital foundation for rendering in-patient clinical
services; or
b.where the physician receives any direct or indirect remuneration from a hospital or
hospital foundation for rendering in-patient clinical services, if the physician establishes
that such remuneration has been reduced by an amount equal to the amount that would
be eligible for payment to the physician had he or she not received any such direct or
indirect remuneration.
3.E082 is not eligible for payment for transfers within the same hospital.
4.E082 is not applicable to any other service or premium.
[Commentary:
1.E082 is only eligible for payment when the admitting physician is the MRP. If the MRP does
not render the admission assessment, E082 is not eligible for payment for any service
rendered by any physician during that hospital admission.
2.E082 is not eligible for payment for a patient admitted for obstetrical delivery or for a
newborn.
3.E082 is not applicable for any consultation or assessment related to day surgery.]

B. Subsequent Visit
Definition:
A subsequent visit is any routine assessment in hospital following the hospital admission assessment.
Attendance at Surgery: If, in the interest of the patient, the referring physician is asked to be
present by the patient or the patient’s representative, but does not assist at the procedure, the
attendance at surgery by the referring physician constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.
Multidisciplinary care: Except where a single service for a team of physicians is listed in this
Schedule (e.g. the weekly team fee for dialysis), when the complexity of the medical condition
requires the services of several physicians in different disciplines, each physician visit
constitutes a subsequent visit.
Payment rules:
1. Except in the circumstances outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3, or when a patient is referred from
one physician to another (see Claims submission instruction below), subsequent visits are
limited to one per patient, per day for the first 5 weeks after admission, 3 visits per week from 6
to 13 weeks after admission, and 6 visits per month after 13 weeks. Services in excess of the
limit are not eligible for payment.
2. After 5 weeks of hospitalization, any assessment in hospital required as a result of an acute
intercurrent illness in excess of the weekly or monthly limits set out above constitutes C121 –
“additional visit due to intercurrent illness”. The weekly or monthly limits set out above do not
apply to additional visits due to intercurrent illness.
3. Pediatric subsequent visits (C262) are limited to one per patient, per day for the duration of the
admission.
4. When a physician is already in the hospital and assesses one of his/her own patients or patients
transferred to his/her care, the service constitutes a subsequent visit. If a physician assesses
another physician’s patient on an emergency basis, the General Listings (“A” prefix) apply.
Claims submission instruction:
When a hospital in-patient is referred from one physician to another physician, the date the second
physician assessed the patient for the first time is considered the “admission date” for the purposes of
determining the appropriate subsequent visit fee code.
[Commentary:
When a hospital in-patient is transferred from one physician to another physician, subsequent
visits by the second physician are calculated based on the actual admission date of the
patient.]
