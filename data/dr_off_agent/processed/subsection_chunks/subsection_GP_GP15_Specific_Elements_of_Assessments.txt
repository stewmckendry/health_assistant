A. A direct physical encounter with the patient including taking a patient history and performing a
physical examination.
B. Other inquiry (including taking a patient history), carried out to arrive at an opinion as to the nature
of the patient’s condition, (whether such inquiry takes place before, during or after the encounter
during which the physical examination takes place) and/or follow-up care.
C. Performing any procedure(s) during the same encounter as the physical examination, unless the
procedure(s) is(are) separately listed in the Schedule and an amount is payable for the procedure

D. Making arrangements for any related assessments, procedures or therapy, and/or interpreting
results.
