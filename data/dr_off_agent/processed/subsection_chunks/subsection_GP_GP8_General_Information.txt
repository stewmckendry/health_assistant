GENERAL INFORMATION
[Commentary: Services Insured by OHIP
The Schedule is established under section 37.1 of regulation 552 under the Act. The fees listed
are the amounts payable by OHIP for insured services. Insured services under the Act are
limited to those which are listed in this Schedule, medically necessary, are not otherwise
excluded by legislation or regulation, and are rendered personally by physicians or by others
delegated to perform them where such delegation is authorized in accordance with the
Schedule requirements for delegated services.
Some services are specifically listed as uninsured in regulation 552, section 24 of the Act (see
Appendix A), such as a service that is solely for the purpose of altering or restoring
appearance. Other services may be uninsured depending on the circumstances. An example
of a service which is uninsured in limited circumstances is psychotherapy, which is uninsured
where it is a requirement for the patient to obtain a diploma or degree or to fulfill a course of
study. Other examples of commonly uninsured services include missed appointments or
procedures, circumcision except if medically necessary, and certain services rendered and
documents and forms completed in connection with non-medically necessary requests (e.g. life
insurance application).]
[Commentary: Modifications to the Schedule
Under agreement between the MOH and the OMA, additions, deletions, fee changes, or other
modifications to the Schedule, are made by the MOH following consultation and/or negotiation
with the OMA. Physicians who wish to have modifications to the Schedule considered should
submit any proposals to the Physician Payment Committee (PPC) through the appropriate
clinical section of the OMA.
In the situation where a new therapy or procedure is being introduced into Ontario, and the
physicians performing the new therapy or procedure wish to have a new fee item inserted into
the Schedule, the following process is recommended.
An application for a new fee related to the new therapy or procedure should be submitted by
the appropriate section(s) of the OMA to the PPC for consideration, with documentation
supporting the introduction of this item into the Schedule. The PPC will advise OHIP whether or
not this new therapy is experimental. If the PPC and the MOH agree that the item is
experimental, the service is deemed uninsured (in accordance with section 24 of regulation
552 under the Act), and will not be introduced into the Schedule. If the MOH, on the advice of
the PPC, determines that the new therapy or procedure is not experimental, the fee application
will be handled in the usual manner as detailed above.]
[Commentary: Medical Research
Examinations or procedures for the purpose of a research or survey program are not insured
services, nor are services provided by a laboratory or a hospital that support an examination or
procedure that is for the purpose of research or a survey. The exception to this is that an
assessment conducted to determine if an insured person is suitable for such a program is not
necessarily an uninsured service (see section 24 of regulation 552 under the Act - this is
provided as Appendix A of the Schedule).]
[Commentary: Medical Records
All insured services must be documented in appropriate records. The Act requires that the
record establish that:
1.an insured service was provided;
2.the service for which the account is submitted is the service that was rendered; and
3.the service was medically necessary.
The medical record requirements as found in the Act are listed in Appendix G of the Schedule.]

GENERAL INFORMATION
GENERAL PAYMENT RULES
[Commentary:
Claims for payment must be submitted to OHIP in the form and by the medium (e.g. electronic
data transmission; machine readable input) as set out in sections 38.3 to 38.5 of regulation 552
under the Act and must contain the information required by the regulation and the General
Manager of OHIP. Regulation 552 under the Act can be found at:
http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Regs/English/900552_e.htm.
Claims must be submitted within three months of the date the service was rendered, except in
extenuating circumstances. A claim cannot be accepted for payment unless it meets all of the
technical and formal requirements set out in the Act and regulations.]
1. The fee is payable only to the physician who rendered the service personally, or by the
physician whose delegate rendered the service where delegation is authorized in accordance
with the Schedule.
2. Where more than one physician renders different components of a listed service, only one fee is
payable for that service, and the fee is payable only where the Schedule provides that different
physicians may perform different components of the service.
[Commentary:
Where an insured service contains several components (e.g. surgical procedures that include
post-operative care or fracture care), the components of the service are not divisible among
physicians for claims purposes and the physicians are responsible for apportioning payment
amongst themselves.]
3. Where the Schedule provides that different physicians may substitute for one another in
performing the total service, only one fee is payable for the service.
[Commentary:
When physicians routinely or frequently substitute for each other in providing hospital visits to
registered bed patients in active treatment hospitals, e.g. weekend coverage or daily rounds by
various members of a group, the most responsible physician may claim for all the visits.]
Specialist services
When a service rendered by a specialist comprises part of an insured consultation or assessment that
falls within the scope of his or her specialist practice, the service is not eligible for payment unless the
claim for the service is submitted either:
a. unless otherwise noted, in respect of a service described in the portions of the Consultations
and Visits section of this Schedule that reflects the physician’s Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Canada specialty, as documented in the records maintained by the MOH
for claims payment purposes; or
b. in respect of a service described in this Schedule under the following sub-headings which
can be claimed by any specialty: psychotherapy, counselling, HIV primary care, palliative
care support, hypnotherapy, certification of mental illness, interviews, genetic assessments,
midwife or aboriginal midwife-requested emergency and special emergency assessments,
home care application, or home care supervision.

GENERAL PREAMBLE
GENERAL INFORMATION
When a service rendered by a specialist does not fall within the scope of the specialist’s practice and/
or the specialist is providing primary care in a family or general practice setting, the service is only
eligible for payment when the claim is submitted using the appropriate code from the “Family Practice
& Practice in General” listings.
When more than one assessment is rendered to a patient during the same visit by the same physician
who is qualified in one or more specialties, only one assessment is payable.
[Commentary:
Any additional assessment is not eligible for payment.]
Use of Codes, Prefixes and Suffixes
[Commentary:
Services are generally, but not necessarily, listed by anatomical system or specialty for
convenience.]
The alpha-numeric fee code opposite the service listing in this Schedule must be set out in the claim
submitted, together with the required suffix.
Surgical Codes: In the surgical part of the Schedule, the required suffixes are:
suffix A if the physician performs the procedure;
suffix B if the physician assisted at the surgery; and
suffix C if the physician administered the anaesthetic.

GENERAL PAYMENT RULES
Diagnostic Services Rendered at a Hospital
The technical component of those diagnostic services that are listed with "technical component" or in
a column headed "H" or "T" is not eligible for payment if the service is rendered to a patient who:
1. is an in-patient of a hospital; or
2. attends a hospital where he or she receives an insured diagnostic service; and
3. within 24 hours of receiving that diagnostic service, is admitted to the same hospital as an in-
patient in connection with the same condition, illness, injury or disease in relation to which the
diagnostic service was rendered.
[Commentary:
1.For those diagnostic services which have both technical and professional components listed
under one fee schedule code, the technical and professional components are claimed
separately. The claim for the technical component is submitted using the fee schedule code
with the suffix B and the claim for the professional component is submitted using the fee
schedule code with a suffix C.
2.The technical component may be listed as either "technical component" or in a column
headed "H" or "T". The professional component may be listed as either "professional
component" or in a column headed "P".]
The technical component of a diagnostic service listed in the column headed with an "H" and rendered
outside of a hospital is not eligible for payment under the Health Insurance Act.

including data acquisition, reporting, and record keeping. The physician must be able to
demonstrate the above upon request by the MOH.

section in the General Preamble of this Schedule.]
Consultation and Assessment Codes
There are four different prefixes used for consultations and assessments listed in the “Consultations
and Visits” section of the Schedule. The codes with the “A” prefix are described as the “General
Listings”. These must be used when submitting a claim for consultations and assessments except in
the following situations when the code listed below must be used:
1. acute care hospital – non-emergency in-patient services – “C” prefix codes;
2. long term care institution – non-emergency in-patient services – “W” prefix codes;
3. emergency department – services rendered by a physician on duty – “H” prefix (H1- codes); or
4. rehabilitation unit – services rendered by a specialist in Physical Medicine – “H” prefix codes
(H3XX codes)
[Commentary:
Submit claim using an “A” prefix assessment when an assessment is rendered in conjunction
with a special visit premium. Information regarding when special visit premiums are payable is
found on pages GP65 to GP78 of the General Preamble.]
Independent Consideration (IC)
Services listed in the Schedule without specified fees are identified as “IC” and are given independent
consideration by the medical consultant. Claims for such services must be submitted with a
supporting letter explaining the amount of the fee claimed, and must include an appropriate operative
or consultation report, and a comparison of the scope and difficulty of the procedure in relation to non-
IC procedures in the Schedule. For treatment of tumours not listed in the Schedule, surgeons must
use the IC code, R993, and for surgical procedures not listed, but similar to a listed service, the code,
R990.
