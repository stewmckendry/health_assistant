SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
Special visit means a visit initiated by a patient or an individual on behalf of the patient for the purpose
of rendering a non-elective service or, if rendered in the patient's home, a non-elective or elective
service.
A special visit premium is payable in respect of a special visit rendered to an insured person, subject
to the conditions and limitations set out below. All special visit premiums are subject to the maximums,
limitations and conditions set out in the "Special Visit Premium Table" applicable in the circumstances.
Payment rules:
1.Special visit premiums are only eligible for payment when rendered with certain services
listed under "Consultations and Visits" and "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures"
sections of this Schedule.
2.Regardless of the time of day at which the service is rendered, special visit premiums are not
eligible for payment in the following circumstances:
a.for patients seen during rounds at a hospital or long-term care institution (including a
nursing home or home for the aged);
b.in conjunction with admission assessments of patients who have been admitted to
hospital on an elective basis;
c.for non-referred or transferred obstetrical patients except, in the case of transferred
obstetrical patients for a special visit for obstetrical delivery with sacrifice of office hours
for the first patient seen (C989);
d.for services rendered in a place, other than a hospital or long-term care facility, that is
scheduled to be open for the purpose of diagnosing or treating patients;
e.for a visit for which critical care team fees are payable under this Schedule;
f. in conjunction with any sleep study service listed in the sleep studies section of this
Schedule; or
g.for services rendered to patients who present to an office without an appointment while
the physician is there, or for patients seen immediately before, during or immediately after
routine or ordinary office hours even if held at night or on weekends or holidays.
3.Special visit premiums are not eligible for payment with services described by emergency
department "H" prefix fee codes.
[Commentary:
For elective home visits rendered during daytime, evenings, nights or weekends, submit
claim(s) using fee codes found under the column titled "Elective Home Visit" of Special Visit
Premium Table VI listed on page GP75.]
Sacrifice of office hours means an insured service rendered when the demands of the patient and/or
the patient's condition are such that the physician makes a previously unscheduled non-elective visit
to the patient at a time when the physician had an office visit booked with one or more patients but,
because of the previously unscheduled non-elective visit, any such office visit was delayed or
cancelled.

SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
PREMIUMS
[Commentary:
Special visit premiums are in respect of either or both: a "travel premium" and a "patient seen"
premium (i.e. "first person seen premium" or "an additional person seen premium").]
A. Travel Premium
Definition/required elements of service:
A travel premium is only eligible for payment for travel from one location to another location ("the
destination") subject to the payment rules below.
A travel premium is not eligible for payment when a physician is required to travel from one location to
another within the same long-term care facility, hospital complex or within buildings situated on the
same hospital campus.
[Commentary:
1.A first person seen premium may be eligible for payment in this circumstance.
2.Only one travel premium is eligible for payment for each separate trip to a destination
regardless of the number of patients seen in association with each trip.]
B. First person seen premium
A first person seen premium is eligible for payment for the first person seen at the destination under
one of the following circumstances ("the eligible times"):
1. if the insured service is commenced evenings (17:00 hr-24:00 hr) Monday to Friday; daytime or
evenings on Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays; or nights (24:00 hr-07:00 hr);
2. if rendered requiring sacrifice of office hours; or
3. if rendered during daytime hours (07:00 - 17:00 hrs Monday through Friday) in circumstances in
which a travel premium is eligible for payment.
C. Additional person premium
An additional person premium is only eligible for payment for services rendered at the destination to
additional patients seen in emergency departments, outpatient departments, long-term care
institutions or to hospital inpatients, provided that each additional patient service is commenced
during the eligible times.
[Commentary:
Special visit premiums are not eligible for payment for elective services rendered at a long-term
care institution, including a nursing home or home for the aged, even when the long-term care
institution is the "home" of the patient.
Submit claims for routine elective visits in these locations as subsequent visits. For example, if
the physician is called to a nursing home to see a patient for a non-elective problem at 8AM,
and subsequently sees his/her routine patients on rounds, those additional patients do not
qualify for the additional person premium.]

Premiums", the special visit premiums listed under Table X are only eligible for payment to:

[Commentary:
Emergency room physicians may be primarily funded either through an Emergency
Department Alternate Funding Arrangement (ED-AFA) or fee-for-service.]
In addition to the general restrictions regarding special visits as outlined above, there are specific
restrictions which apply to special visit premiums for services rendered in the emergency department
by Emergency Department Physicians (as defined above). These limits are listed in the Special Visit
Premiums table under the heading “Emergency Department by Emergency Department Physician”

department.

(Table I) apply (GP70). For patients assessed during this visit to the emergency department
beyond the defined limits, submit claims for all subsequent patients using the "H" prefix listings.

1.A physician who supervises a medical trainee who renders an insured service is eligible to
be paid for the insured service as if the supervising physician performed the service
personally, subject to any terms, conditions and limitations found in this section.
2.The sole purpose of the terms and conditions described in this section is to define when a
service is payable by OHIP. These terms and conditions do not alter the College of

Education requirements or any requirements of the institutions responsible for postgraduate
medical education.]
Note:
Unless otherwise specified in this section, all other payment requirements in the Schedule
related to any service that is performed by a Medical Trainee are applicable.
DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this section of the Schedule only, the following Definitions apply:
Supervision: Supervision is performed by the Supervising Physician and includes the
responsibility to guide, observe and assess the educational activities of
the Medical Trainee and assures the quality of an insured service while
being rendered by the Medical Trainee.
Supervision is only performed:
a. in person, by telephone, or videoconference, the method being consistent with the acuity of
the service being rendered by the Medical Trainee as well as the Medical Trainee’s level of
competence;
b. when the service is provided within a setting approved by the educational institution where
the Medical Trainee is registered; and
c. when the service is within the scope and oversight of the postgraduate medical training
program in which the Medical Trainee is registered.
[Commentary:
The Supervising Physician and the Medical Trainee must be physically present in Ontario.]
Supervising The Supervising Physician is a physician who performs Supervision of a
Physician Medical Trainee who renders an insured service to an insured person.

SUPERVISION OF POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL TRAINEES
Payment Rules
A. GENERAL
1. A service rendered by a Medical Trainee is only eligible for payment to the Supervising
Physician where Supervision is provided as defined above and subject to the specific
requirements below.
2. Where a Resident with an OHIP billing number is providing insured services independently and
outside their training program, the insured service is not eligible for payment to a Supervising
Physician as there is no Supervision provided.
[Commentary:
In the scenario described above the Resident is not performing the service as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Resident would bill OHIP for the service provided.]
3. Where a Clinical Fellow with an OHIP billing number is providing insured services
independently and outside their training program, the insured service is not eligible for payment
to a Supervising Physician as there is no Supervision provided.
[Commentary:
In the scenario described above the Clinical Fellow is not performing the services as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Clinical Fellow would bill OHIP for the services provided. For
example, an orthopedic surgeon may be enrolled in a sarcoma surgery clinical fellowship but
has privileges as a general orthopedic surgeon and may perform, and be eligible for payment,
for rendering a service such as an open reduction of a fracture that is not being supervised by
a Supervising Physician.]
4. Special Visit premiums are not eligible for payment to the Supervising Physician unless the
Supervising Physician personally satisfies the payment requirements for a special visit
premium.
5. The following services are not eligible for payment to the Supervising Physician when rendered
by a Medical Trainee:
a. Case Conferences;
b. Multidisciplinary Cancer Conferences;
c. Provider-to-provider services, including:

b. is physically present in the clinical facility at the time the service is rendered; and
c. is immediately available to personally attend the patient when requested by the Resident or
other health care professional.

service concurrently, only the time units rendered by one Medical Trainee are eligible for
payment to the same Supervising Physician.]
D. NUMBER OF MEDICAL TRAINEES
The following table describes the maximum number of services that are payable for services rendered
concurrently by Medical Trainee(s) and the Supervising Physician.

E. Forms
1. An insured service listed in the Schedule that includes the completion of a form is not eligible for
payment to a Supervising Physician if rendered by a Medical Trainee unless the form has been
reviewed and signed by the Supervising Physician.
F. Medical Record Requirements
1. A service is only eligible for payment to the Supervising Physician when the medical record of
the patient(s) identifies the following information at the time of the provision of the service:

d. Patient consent to the Supervision of services of a Medical Trainee; and
e. Where the service rendered is a Time-Based service, the Supervising Physician has at a
minimum, reviewed the nature and outcome of the service and the patient record(s), with the
Medical Trainee.
2. In addition to the requirements in 1 above, the Supervising Physician must have:
a. signed off on the service rendered by the Medical Trainee in the patient’s medical record; or
b. where the Supervising Physician was not immediately available to sign off on the service
rendered by the Medical Trainee, the Medical Trainee has written the date and time a
discussion occurred with the Supervising Physician regarding the provision of the service in
the patient’s medical record.
[Commentary:
Each entry into the patient’s medical record does not need to contain all of the above medical
record keeping requirements. However, it must be evident upon review of the entire medical
record that all requirements were met at the time of the provision of the Supervised service.
Supervision of the Medical Trainee by the Supervising Physician must be evident in the
medical record. This may include a physical visit to the patient and/or a chart review and
detailed discussion between the Supervising Physician, the Medical Trainee, and other
member(s) of the health team.
The service date to be used for claims is the date the Medical Trainee rendered the insured
service to the patient.]

GENERAL PREAMBLE
ANAESTHESIOLOGISTS’ SERVICES
a. where multiple or bilateral surgical procedures are performed during the same anaesthetic,
the number of basic units listed in the column headed with “Anae” opposite the service that
describes the major procedure; or
b. where the basic units are listed as IC, or where no basic units are listed, the amount payable
is calculated by adding the appropriate time units to the basic units listed for a comparable
procedure (taking into account the region, modifying conditions, or techniques).
Time Units: Time units are calculated on the basis of time spent by the anaesthesiologist and
commence when the anaesthesiologist is first in attendance with the patient in the OR for the purpose
of initiating anaesthesia and end when the anaesthesiologist is no longer in attendance (when the
patient may safely be placed under customary post-operative supervision). Time units are calculated
for each 15 minutes or part thereof. The unit value of each 15 minute period or part thereof is:
During the first hour ................................................................ 1 unit
After the first hour up to and including the first 1.5 hours ....... 2 units
After 1.5 hours ........................................................................ 3 units
Claims submission instruction:
Submit claims for anaesthesia services rendered with a surgical procedure using the suffix “C”, with
