than solely for preoperative preparation of the patient.
2.G315, G319, G174, G111 and G112 are uninsured services for routine annual stress tests in
asymptomatic patients where the patient's 10 year risk of coronary heart disease is less than
10% calculated by generally accepted methodology.
[Commentary:
An example of a generally accepted methodology for determining 10 year risk of coronary
heart disease is the Framingham Risk Score.
1.Studies have indicated that for non cardiac surgery, there may be no clinical benefit and
there may be harm in performing functional cardiac testing in patients with low operative risk
and little or limited benefit in moderate risk patients. BMJ 2010, Jan 28; 340.
2.One example of a generally accepted guideline is the American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines that states:
a.Non invasive testing could be considered in patients with 1 to 2 risk factors and poor
functional capacity (less than 4 mets) who require intermediate risk surgery if it will
change management (class IIb)
b.Non invasive testing has not been show to be useful in patients with no clinical risk factors
undergoing intermediate risk non cardiac surgery (class III).
c.Non invasive testing has not been shown to useful in patients undergoing low risk non
cardiac surgery (class III).]

Life threatening critical care and other critical care
The duration of "life threatening critical care" and "other critical care" services that physicians
should document is the time they actually spend evaluating, managing, and providing care to
the critically ill or injured patient to the exclusion of all other work.
For example, time spent reviewing laboratory test results or discussing the critically ill patient's
care with other medical staff in the unit or at the nursing station on the floor would be included
in the definition of critical care, even when it does not occur at the bedside, if this time
represents their full attention to the management of the critically ill/injured patient.
Time spent involved in activities in any location other than the bedside, emergency department
or hospital floor where the patient is located cannot be claimed as the physician is not
immediately available to the patient.
Submit claims manually when the total time spent in providing "life threatening critical care" or

CHRONIC DIALYSIS TEAM FEE
Chronic Dialysis Team Fee is the all-inclusive benefit per patient per week for professional aspects of
managing chronic dialysis and end-stage renal failure in dialysis patients. It is a modality independent
fee and is equal in monetary value whether the dialysis is delivered in hospital, community or home
and whether it is haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The team fee includes the services of all
physicians routinely or periodically participating in the patient's dialysis treatment at:
a. the patient's principal treatment centre; or
b. at a place other than the patient's principal treatment centre (auxiliary treatment centre)
where 3 or more dialysis treatments are rendered to the patient during the 7-day period

The amount payable is in respect of a 7-day period of care, commencing at midnight Sunday and is
payable to the most responsible physician.
Except as set out below, the amount payable to another physician in respect of these services
rendered to a patient in respect of whom a claim is submitted and paid for this code is nil.
When a full 7-day period of team care is not rendered at the patient's principal treatment centre due to
absence of the patient with treatment at an auxiliary treatment centre, the amount claimed for
treatment at the principal treatment centre is reduced on a pro rata basis to equal 1/7 of the weekly
fee for each day that the patient is the responsibility of the principal treatment centre.
In addition to the common elements of insured services and the specific elements of Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Procedures, the team fee includes the following elements:
A. All consultations and visits for management and supervision of chronic dialysis treatments
regardless of frequency, type or location of service and includes chronic dialysis of hospital in-
patients.
B. All consultations and visits within the scope of practice of nephrology and general internal medicine
for assessment and treatment of complications of chronic dialysis and management of end-stage
renal disease and its complications in chronic dialysis patients.
C. All related counselling, interviews, psychotherapy of patients and family members.
D. All related case conferences.
The team fee does not include:
A. Assessments and special visit premiums for emergent calls to the emergency department.
B. Admission assessments and subsequent visits to acute care hospital in-patients for treatment of
complications of dialysis, chronic renal disease or intercurrent illness.
C. Any other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, including acute dialysis treatments.
D. Consultations and assessments by specialists in other than internal medicine or internal medicine
sub-specialists other than nephrologists.
E. Primary care by the patient's family physician.
F. Assessment by a renal transplantation specialist for entry into a transplantation program.

2. Nerve blocks rendered for acute pain with a duration of action of less than 4 hours, topical
anaesthesia or local infiltration used as an anaesthetic for any procedure, are not eligible for
payment.
3. Except as described in paragraph 4, when a physician administers an anaesthetic, nerve block
and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in conjunction with a
diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs on the same patient,
the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication is not eligible for
payment.
4. A major or minor peripheral nerve block, major plexus block, neuraxial injection (with or without
catheter) or intrapleural block (with or without catheter) for post-operative pain control (with a
duration of action more than 4 hours) is eligible for payment as G224 when rendered in
conjunction with a procedure which the physician performs on the same patient.

Definition/Required elements of service:
This is the service rendered by the neurosurgery specialist most responsible for management of a
critically ill hospital in-patient with an acquired acute brain injury, where the neurosurgeon provides
management:
a. post-operatively for a patient who has received an endovascular intracranial surgical
procedure during the same hospital admission but only if that procedure was not performed
by any neurosurgeon; or
b. for a patient who has not received an intracranial surgical procedure during the same
hospital admission with the exception of Z820, Z812, N115, N139, N174, Z824, Z802, Z825,
Z803.
[Commentary:
1.Examples of acquired acute brain injury include acutely raised intracranial pressure,
subarachnoid, intracerebral or intraventricular haemorrhage, cerebritis, cerebral abscess,
malignant cerebral edema, acute hydrocephalus, ventriculitis and trauma.
2.If a neurosurgeon renders an intracranial surgical procedure not on the exception list above,
Acquired Acute Brain Injury Management is not payable for a post-operative patient to any
physician.]
This service has the same specific elements as consultations and assessments.
In addition the service may include the following elements:
a. An initial consultation or assessment and such subsequent assessments as may be
indicated, including ongoing monitoring of the patient's condition and intervening as
appropriate;
b. management of coma and monitoring the life support systems to ensure optimum
neurological perfusion and oxygenation;
c. management of intracranial pressure (excluding insertion of I.C.P. or brain oxygen/pH
measuring device) including monitoring, interpretation and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid
when indicated;
d. monitoring and management of cerebral vasospasm;
e. prophylaxis and management of seizures;
f. making arrangements for any related assessments, procedures or therapy, related to the
patient’s acute neurological deterioration, including decompressive craniectomy, cerebral
angioplasty or evacuation of intracranial space occupying lesions;
g. clinical and radiological assessment of the cervical spine and spinal cord for the
determination of spinal stability;
h. performance and/or arranging tests for the establishment of a diagnosis of brain death
i. making referrals, when appropriate, to organ procurement professionals

supervision of drug infusion and personal application of non-thermal diode laser for activation
of verteporfin.
PDT is insured only if the patient's clinical condition meets all of the following:
a. the patient has predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
secondary to either age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Presumed Ocular
Histoplasmosis Syndrome or pathologic myopia. Predominantly means that the area of
classic subfoveal CNV is equal to or greater than 50% of the total CNV lesion, as determined
by fluorescein angiography and documented by retinal photographs retained on the patient's
permanent medical record;
b. treatment is commenced within 30 months after initial diagnosis of predominantly classic
subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD, Presumed Ocular Histoplasmosis Syndrome or
pathologic myopia;
c. the patient's visual acuity is equal to or worse than 20/40; and
d. for each repeat therapy, recurrent or persistent CNV leakage is detected by fluorescein
angiography and documented by retinal photographs retained on the patient's permanent
medical record.
If the patient's clinical condition meets all the above criteria but retinal photographs are not
made prior to the procedure and retained on the patient's permanent medical record or the
procedure is not performed by an ophthalmologist, then PDT is not eligible for payment.
Maximum one PDT (unilateral or bilateral) per patient per day.

B.Basic DHTs are insured services payable at nil unless:
1. the professional component is rendered personally by a physician qualified by appropriate
education or training and experience to perform basic DHTs (qualified physician); and
2. the technical component is either rendered by a qualified physician or delegated by a qualified
physician to a person who is either an appropriately qualified employee of the physician or is an
audiologist who is a member of the College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists
of Ontario and employed by a public hospital.
C.Advanced DHTs are insured services payable at nil unless:
1. the professional component is personally rendered by an otolaryngologist or, for evoked
audiometry, a neurologist or by a non-certified physician with equivalent post-graduate
academic training (appropriate specialist or equivalent); and
2. the technical component is personally rendered by an appropriate specialist or equivalent, or
delegated by an appropriate specialist or equivalent to an audiologist who is a member of the
College of Audiologists and Speech-Language Pathologists of Ontario and is employed by the
appropriate specialist or equivalent or a public hospital.
D.Physicians submitting claims for DHTs shall maintain written records of appropriate qualifications
as indicated above for themselves and those employees to whom they may delegate the technical
component. Such records must be made available to the ministry on request. In the absence of
such records, the DHT is an insured service payable at nil.
[Commentary:
1.Delegated DHT services - To qualify for payment, delegated DHT services must comply with
the requirements for delegation of insured services described in the General Preamble
GP62.
2.Interpretation of DHT services - To qualify for payment, the physician who claims the
professional component must personally interpret the DHT and cannot delegate the
interpretation to another person.
3.Controlled Acts - Communicating to the individual or his or her personal representative a
diagnosis identifying a disease or disorder as the cause of symptoms of the individual in
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that the individual or his or her personal
representative will rely on the diagnosis, or prescribing a hearing aid for a hearing impaired
person are controlled acts. If a physician interprets a diagnostic hearing test without
communicating the diagnosis to the patient or his or her personal representative, a controlled
act has not occurred.
4.Fixed level screening audiometry is not an insured service.
5.DHTs at the request of or arranged by third party, e.g. school boards, employers or WSIB etc.
are not insured services. See Appendix A regarding third party service.]

SLEEP STUDIES
For the purpose of sleep studies (including overnight sleep studies in non-specialized facilities,
overnight sleep studies rendered in specialized facilities and daytime sleep studies),
“CPSO Standards” means the publication of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario
entitled “Independent Health Facilities, Clinical Practice Parameters and Facility Standards, Sleep
Medicine” in effect 6 months prior to the date upon which the sleep study was rendered.
“off-site premises” means off-site premises operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
“prior approval” means approved for payment as an insured service, before the service is rendered,
by the Ministry of Health following assessment on a case-by-case basis in accordance with all
medically relevant criteria.
[Commentary:
A “physician practicing sleep medicine” refers to a physician who meets the Medical Staff
requirements as defined in Chapter 2 of the “Independent Health Facilities, Clinical Practice
Parameters and Facility Standards, Sleep Medicine, September 2010 from the CPSO.]
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Sleep Studies are divided into a professional component listed in the columns headed with a "P", and
a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H" (the technical component).
The specific elements for the technical component H include the specific elements for the technical
component of non-invasive diagnostic procedures listed in the Preamble to Diagnostic and
Therapeutic Procedures.
If the physician is physically present during the study, the physician’s physical presence is a specific
element of the technical and professional components.
OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
For services rendered outside a hospital or off-site premises, the only fees payable under the Health
Insurance Act are for the professional component listed under the “P” column (use suffix C). Costs for
the technical component of these services are only payable under the Integrated Community Health
Services Centres Act, 2023 and are listed in the Schedule of Facility Costs.
Sleep studies are subject to limits or maximums set out below. Unless otherwise specifically provided,
service(s) in excess of limits are not insured services except when prior approval to exceed the limit is
obtained from the MOH. Despite the foregoing, where prior approval to exceed a limit is not requested
from the MOH but the service would otherwise satisfy one or more of the conditions for which prior
approval to exceed the limit is routinely granted (had prior approval been requested) any service in
excess of the limit is not eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
For definitions of maximum and limits see GP7.]

Repeat diagnostic study
“Repeat diagnostic study” means an overnight diagnostic sleep study rendered:
a. for the purpose of obtaining a second opinion at a different facility than the facility where the
preceding study was rendered, provided that the following conditions are met:
i. prior to the repeat diagnostic study, the patient has been assessed by a physician who
practices sleep medicine at the different facility,
[Commentary:
The different facility requirement above applies to a repeat diagnostic study rendered at a
hospital, a hospital off-site premise or an ICHSC.]
ii. where the previous study was rendered at an ICHSC and the repeat diagnostic study is
rendered at a different ICHSC (the “different facility”) than the ICHSC where the
preceding study was rendered (the “first facility”), neither the owner nor the operator of
the different facility is, at the time the repeat study is rendered, an associate of the
owner or operator of the first facility, where “associate” has the same meaning as in the
Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023; or
b. for one or more of the following purposes, after pre-study assessment by a physician
practicing sleep medicine:
i. re-evaluation of a previous negative or inconclusive diagnostic sleep study as indicated
by persistent or progressive symptoms;
ii. re-evaluation, other than primarily for Positive Airway Pressure therapy (PAP)
adjustment, of patients previously diagnosed with a primary sleep disorder in which
there has been symptom development suggesting another co-morbid sleep disorder; or
iii. re-evaluation of patients with an established diagnosis of a sleep disorder other than a
sleep related breathing disorder who have significant symptom progression or non-
response to therapy.
[Commentary:
1.In the case of patients with previously diagnosed sleep related breathing disorders, although
PAP treatment may be adjusted during a repeat study, a repeat study is not eligible for
payment if rendered primarily for PAP treatment adjustment.
2.Examples of sleep disorders other than a sleep related breathing disorder are Narcolepsy,
Idiopathic hypersomnia and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder.]

for a sleep related breathing disorder.]
Note:
1.For payment purposes, repeat diagnostic studies or therapeutic studies for indications or in
circumstances other than listed above, or in excess of the limits set out above require prior
approval.
2.A repeat diagnostic study rendered without the required pre-study assessment by a
physician practicing sleep medicine, is not eligible for payment.
3.A therapeutic study rendered without a pre-study assessment by a physician practicing sleep
medicine is not eligible for payment except:
a.For the therapeutic study that immediately follows an initial diagnostic or repeat
diagnostic study where:
i. the time interval is such that it is unlikely the clinical circumstances of the patient has
changed; and
ii. the physician practicing sleep medicine has previously assessed the patient and
documented the applicable decisions with respect to the performance of the
therapeutic study; or
b.In exceptional circumstances where the physician can demonstrate to the ministry upon
request that the CPSO standards are satisfied with the use of a clinical protocol or
approved medical directive.
[Commentary:
1.An example of an exceptional circumstance may be where a patient is required to travel a
long distance to a sleep facility and requires an initial diagnostic or repeat diagnostic study
followed by a therapeutic study on a subsequent night. For payment purposes, a pre-study
assessment by a physician practicing sleep medicine is not required provided the therapeutic
study is rendered in accordance with a clinical protocol or medical directive that has been
approved by an authority other than a physician affiliated with the sleep facility (e.g. a
Medical Advisory Committee for a sleep clinic affiliated with a hospital). The physician should
be prepared to provide any necessary supporting documentation to the ministry upon
request.
2.Prior approval, where required, will typically be dependent on the physician demonstrating
that the study is generally accepted as necessary for the patient under the circumstances.
3.Sleep studies that require prior approval also require a pre-study assessment by a physician
practicing sleep medicine. It is this assessment upon which the request for prior approval is
considered.
