SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Diagnostic Ultrasound procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the columns
headed with a “P”, and a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H". The technical
component of the procedures subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
In addition to the common elements, the components of Diagnostic Ultrasound procedures include the
following specific elements.

A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate.

separately billable.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect of D that is performed at a place other than the place in which
the procedure is performed.
Note:
1.Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
2.If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B
and C, these may be delegated to another physician.
3.Where the only component provided is interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure,
the specific elements A and C listed for the professional component are included in the
specific elements of the technical component.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for the technical
component H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional
component are submitted using listed fee code with suffix C. (e.g. J102C)
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health

these services are only billable under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act,
2023 and are listed in the Schedule of Facility Costs.
3. A-Mode - implies a one-dimensional ultrasonic measurement procedure.
4. M-Mode - implies a one-dimensional ultrasonic measurement procedure with movement of the
trace to record amplitude and velocity of moving echo-producing structures.
5. Scan B-Mode - implies a two-dimensional ultrasonic scanning procedure with a two-dimensional
display. All ultrasound examinations include a permanent record and interpretative report.
6. If insured diagnostic ultrasound procedures yield abnormal findings or if they would yield
information which in the opinion of the interpreting physician would be insufficient governed by
the needs of the patient and the requirements of the referring provider or practitioner, the
interpreting physician may add further views and claim for them (if listed).
