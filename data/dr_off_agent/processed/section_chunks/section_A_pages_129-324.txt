CASE CONFERENCES
PREAMBLE
Definition/Required elements of service:
Where the conditions set out in this Schedule are met, a case conference is an insured service
despite paragraph 6 of s. 24(1) of Regulation 552. A case conference is a pre-scheduled meeting,
conducted for the purpose of discussing and directing the management of an individual patient. The
required elements are applicable for all case conferences, except in circumstances where these
requirements are modified for specific case conferences, as indicated. A case conference:
a. must be conducted by personal attendance, videoconference or by telephone (or any
combination thereof);
b. must involve at least 2 other participants who meet the eligible participant requirements as
indicated in the specific listed case conference services; and
c. at least one of the physician participants is the physician most responsible for the care of the
patient.
[Commentary:
Case conferences for educational purposes such as rounds, journal club, group learning
sessions, or continuing professional development, or any meeting where the conference is not
for the purpose of discussing and directing the management of an individual patient is not a
case conference.]
For case conferences where the time unit is defined in 10 minute increments, the following payment
rules and medical record requirements are applicable, except in circumstances where these
requirements are modified for specific listed case conference services, as indicated.
Note:
“Regulated social worker” refers to a social worker regulated under the Social Work and Social
Service Work Act and who holds a current certificate of registration from the Ontario College of
Social Workers and Social Service Workers.
Case conferences are time based services calculated in time units of 10 minute increments. In
calculating time unit(s), the minimum time required is based upon consecutive time spent participating
in the case conference as follows:
# Units Minimum time
1 unit 10 minutes
2 units 16 minutes
3 units 26 minutes
4 units 36 minutes
5 units 46 minutes
6 units 56 minutes

VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this section of the Schedule only, the following Definitions apply:
Comprehensive Virtual Care Service means a Virtual Care Service rendered where an
Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship exists, and in the physicians’ professional
opinion in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice, the person's care
and support requirements can be effectively and appropriately delivered by Video or
Telephone.
Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship means:
1. Where a physician is providing a Virtual Care Service to a patient where there has been at least
one insured service with a direct physical encounter between the patient and that physician
(Family and General Practice Physician or specialist) in the preceding 24-months; or
2. Where a physician is providing a Virtual Care Service to a patient who has signed the MOH’s
Patient Enrollment and Consent to Release Personal Health Information form and is enrolled to
that physician or another physician within the same group (who is signatory/locum to a MOH
alternate funding plan agreement); or
3. Where a specialist or GP Focused Practice Physician is providing a consultation by Video set
out in Appendix J – Section 1, or has provided any such consultation in the preceding 24-
months to that patient; or
[Commentary:
Where the visit leading to the referral for consultation has occurred virtually, it would be
expected that the referring physician has an established relationship with the patient and that
the clinical issue leading to the referral has been assessed in-person within the previous 12-
months.]
[Commentary:
A consultation billed as an insured service under K083 or as an uninsured service funded
under the Ontario Virtual Care Program and rendered prior to December 1, 2022, is considered
evidence of an Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship.]
[Commentary:
Where a physician who has been paid for a consultation for the patient for the same diagnosis
makes a request for a referral for ongoing management of the patient, the service rendered
following the referral is not payable as a consultation, unless the request for referral, if the
referral is made, allows for an ongoing patient physician relationship in the context of a
consultation by Video.]
4. Where a physician provides any of the following services, or has provided any of the following
services in the preceding 24-months:
• A920 – Medical management of early pregnancy - initial service by Video or
Telephone,
• A945/C945 – Special palliative care consultation by Video,
• A680/C680 – Initial assessment - substance abuse by Video,

in 3 or 4 may be claimed as Comprehensive Virtual Care Services.
2.A special palliative care consultation billed as an insured service under K092/K093 and
rendered prior to December 1, 2022, is considered evidence of an Existing/Ongoing Patient-
Physician Relationship.]
GP Focused Practice Physician means, for the purpose of eligibility to provide a focused
practice consultation by Video (A010, A011, A906, A913, A914), a physician who has been
designated by the bi-lateral MOH-OMA GP Focused Practice Review Committee or a physician
who is eligible for the focused practice psychotherapy premium.
Limited Virtual Care Service means a Virtual Care Service rendered where an Existing/
Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship does not exist, and in the physicians’ professional
opinion in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice, the person's care
and support requirements can be effectively and appropriately delivered by Video or
Telephone.
Verified-Virtual Visit Solution means virtual service delivery platforms listed on Ontario
Health’s public list of verified solutions.
Virtual Care Service means a service provided using information technologies to render
eligible services to patients remotely.

Verified-Virtual Visit Solution;
Terms and Conditions for Virtual Care Services
1. Other than a direct physical encounter, all other requirements and conditions for the appropriate
service as described in the Schedule must be met.
2. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment where it is not medically appropriate to
provide the specific service without a direct physical encounter.
a. If during the course of a Virtual Care Service it becomes apparent that the service cannot be
appropriately completed without a direct physical encounter, the Virtual Care Service is not
eligible for payment (only the service with a direct physical encounter is eligible for
payment).

VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
b. Where a patient requests a virtual visit (is not willing to present in-person, despite the
physician’s advice and availability), physicians may submit a claim for the appropriate fee
code for the service that was rendered virtually.
3. Video services are only eligible for payment when performed using a Verified Virtual Visit
Solution.
[Commentary:
Ontario Health’s public list of verified solutions is available at: https://www.ontariohealth.ca/our-
work/digital-standards/virtual-visits-verification-standard/vendor-list.]
4. All other insured services that are rendered by Video or Telephone to insured persons and that
are not Comprehensive Virtual Care Services, Limited Virtual Care Services, or specifically
listed as insured services or are a component of an insured service are not eligible for payment.
5. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless the delivery modality is documented on
the patient's medical record.
6. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless initiated by the patient or the patient’s
representative, or the service represents a medically necessary follow-up visit to a preceding
visit initiated by the patient or the patient’s representative.
[Commentary:
As per GP15, following an insured service, discussion with, and providing advice and
information, including prescribing therapy to the patient or the patient’s representative, whether
by Telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service is a specific element of the
preceding service and should not be separately claimed. This includes reporting results of
related procedures and/or assessments (when professionally appropriate to report without
additional patient assessment) and monitoring the patient’s condition remotely until the next
medically necessary assessment.
For clarity, administrative staff may co-ordinate appointments and organize care in a manner
analogous to in-person encounters without violating this condition. Similarly, medically
necessary follow-up services may be organized by the provider (or by their staff) without
violating the condition. However, a physician-initiated call to “check-in” on a patient would not
be eligible for payment, nor would any telephone calls or Video encounters conducted for
administrative purposes (such as to inform patients of clinic closures or the availability of
remote services).
Furthermore, services are not eligible for payment when initiated by the physician (or the
physician’s staff) without a clear and medically necessary reason for doing so. For example,
the communication of normal lab work, unless medically necessary (in so far as the clinical
management of the patient is altered) should not be billed.
Physician-initiated communication to provide advice or guidance regarding a previously
rendered service is also not separately eligible/ billable. A common example of this would occur
when a patient is provided with a prescription along with instruction to fill it only upon receipt of
a positive test result. The call to inform the patient of the test result is not eligible for payment
as it would be considered a Specific Element of the initial (refer to: item F, GP15, Schedule of
Benefits).

CONSULTATIONS AND VISITS
VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
As a general rule, the provider should consider whether the remote encounter would have
occurred in their “in-person” practice. In circumstances where an in-person encounter would
not have taken place, it is unlikely that a claim for a virtual service could be supported.
Consultations, which arise from requests from other providers, would not violate the condition
in so far as the patient would have assented to the referral as part of their discussion with the
referring provider.]
7. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless personally performed by the physician
or rendered in accordance with the payment rules regarding supervision of a Medical Trainee.
8. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment for services provided to hospital inpatients or
patients in a Long-Term Care institution unless all of the following requirements have been met:
• The physician providing the service is not the patient's MRP.
• The hospital/Long-Term Care institution does not have a physician on staff and
present in the community with the expertise to render the necessary service, as
documented by the referring physician in the patient’s medical record.
• An assessment with a direct physical encounter by the referring physician must
have been completed within 30 days preceding a virtual in-patient specialist
consultation to confirm the need for a consultation.
9. Services involving a direct physical encounter must be made available by the physician
providing Comprehensive Virtual Care Services, or by the physician’s group, within a clinically
appropriate time-frame, if it becomes apparent during a Virtual Care Service that a service
involving a direct physical encounter is medically necessary, or if at the time of scheduling the
service the patient expresses preference for a service involving a direct physical encounter.
[Commentary:
For the purpose of this provision, with respect to specialist and GP Focused Practice
Physicians, a group is defined as: those physicians in the same hospital specialty call rotation,
or who are co-located in shared clinical physical space, and have shared access to the
patient’s medical record. For family and general practice physicians, a group is defined as:
Patient Enrollment Model physicians who are signatory or contracted to the same specific
group contract (i.e., as identified by the same group billing number), or those physicians who
are co-located in a shared clinical physical space and have shared access to the patient’s
medical record].
10.If during the course of a Virtual Care Service the modality changes (for example, a Telephone
service transitions into a Video service), only the service performed by the modality that
represents the greater part (more than 50%) of the time spent providing the Virtual Care Service
is payable. For time-based services, the combined time of both modalities will be used to
calculate the number of time units eligible for payment.
11. For time-based services, only time spent in direct communication with the patient or the
patient’s representative in the provision of the insured service will be used to calculate the
number of time units eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
Both the patient and physician must be located in Ontario for the services to be insured and
payable under OHIP (see section 37.1 of Regulation 552 under the HIA).]

SPECIAL ANAESTHETIC CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A special anaesthetic consultation is rendered when an anaesthesia (01) specialist provides all
the appropriate elements of a regular consultation and is required to devote at least fifty (50)
minutes of direct contact with the patient exclusive of time spent rendering any other separately
billable intervention to the patient.
A210 Special anaesthetic consultation ............................................ 163.20
Limited consultation for acute pain management
A limited consultation for acute pain management is a consultation which takes place when a
physician is requested by another physician to see a hospital in-patient because of the
complexity or severity of the acute pain condition.
A215 Limited consultation for acute pain management in association
with special visit to hospital in-patient ................................ 69.75
Payment rules:
1.The routine pre-anaesthetic evaluation of the patient required by Reg 965 of the Public
Hospitals Act does not constitute a consultation, regardless of where and when this
evaluation is performed.
2.For A210 the start and stop time of the service must be recorded in the patient’s permanent
medical record
3.A215 is not eligible for payment:
a.with P014C - introduction of catheter for labour analgesia, including the first dose of
medication with or without any combined spinal-epidural injection(s);
b.for management of routine post-operative pain; or
c.for referrals from another anaesthesiologist.
[Commentary:
1.The general anaesthesia service includes a pre-anaesthetic evaluation, with specific
elements as for assessments (see GP15) which does not constitute a consultation
2.P014C - is an anaesthesia service, therefore the pre-anaesthetic evaluation is included in the
service and is not payable as a limited consultation for acute pain management or as any
other consultation or assessment.]

1.A complex rheumatology assessment is for the ongoing management of complex disorders
of the musculoskeletal system, where the complexity of the condition requires the continuing
management by a rheumatologist. It is not intended for the evaluation and/or management of
uncomplicated rheumatologic disorders (e.g. osteoarthritis, bursitis/tendonitis, neck and back
pain).
2.Examples of systemic vasculitides include Churg-Strauss angiitis, polyarteritis nodosa,
Wegener’s granulomatosis, Takayasu’s vasculitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and temporal
arteritis.
3.A consultation or assessment service, as appropriate, may be claimed for the initial
evaluation of a patient. A complex rheumatology assessment is for the ongoing management
of a patient with a complex rheumatology disorder.]
