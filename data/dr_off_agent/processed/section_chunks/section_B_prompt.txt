SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Nuclear Medicine procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the columns headed
with a "P", and a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H". The technical
component of the procedure subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
In addition to the common elements, the components of Nuclear Medicine procedures include the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is(are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
Note:
1.Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
2.If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B
and C, these may be delegated to another physician.
3.Where the only component provided is interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure,
the specific elements A and C listed for the professional component are included in the
specific elements of the technical component.
For Technical Component H
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure(s).
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s representative,
whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretive report of the procedure to the
referring provider.
G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect(s) of A and D of the
professional component that is(are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is
performed.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for the technical
component H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional
component are submitted using listed fee code with suffix C. (e.g. J802C)
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health
Insurance Act are listed under P (use suffix C). Costs for the technical component of these
services are only billable under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.
3. With the exception of J818, J835, J821, J834, J880 or when SPECT is claimed, if quantification
or data manipulation is carried out in addition to visual inspection of imaging studies, add 30%
to the appropriate professional benefit. For claim purposes, use prefix “Y”. Such activity must
add significant diagnostic information not available by inspection alone and does not include
simple image enhancement techniques such as smoothing, background subtraction, etc.
Recording of images on videotape for replay and production of images on the video display of a
computer do not in themselves justify the additional benefit. The claims for cardiac wall motion
studies and calculation of ventricular ejection fraction (J811 and J813) already include an
allowance for data manipulation as a general rule and no additional benefit may be claimed.
The additional computer benefit may be claimed only when additional cardiac quantifications
are performed i.e. stroke volume ratio and volume response curves and/or phase analysis.
4. If examination of Brain, Lung, Liver or Spleen is limited to one view, the benefit (H and P) is to
be reduced by 50%.
5. Repeat studies on the same day may be claimed only after exercise or drug intervention.
6. When tomographic examination (SPECT) is billed, the 30% add-on referred to in paragraph 3
may not be claimed.
7. Costs for the technical component of services rendered in an ICHSC are listed in the Schedule
of Facility Costs.
8. The technical and professional fee components for myocardial perfusion imaging /
echocardiogram/exercise stress test/stress echocardiogram are not eligible for payment in the
routine preoperative preparation or screening of a patient for surgery where the patient will
undergo a low risk procedure or has a low risk of perioperative cardiac complications, unless
there is a clinical indication requiring myocardial perfusion imaging/exercise stress test/cardiac
stress echo studies other than solely for preoperative preparation of the patient.
[Commentary:
1.Studies have indicated that for non cardiac surgery, there may be no clinical benefit and
there may be harm in performing functional cardiac testing in patients with low operative risk
and little or limited benefit in moderate risk patients. BMJ 2010, Jan 28; 340.
2.One example of a generally accepted guideline is the American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines that states:
a.Non invasive testing could be considered in patients with 1 to 2 risk factors and poor
functional capacity (less than 4 mets) who require intermediate risk surgery if it will
change management (class IIb)
b.Non invasive testing has not been show to be useful in patients with no clinical risk factors
undergoing intermediate risk non cardiac surgery (class III).
c.Non invasive testing has not been shown to useful in patients undergoing low risk non
cardiac surgery (class III)]
