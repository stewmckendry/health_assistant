PREAMBLE
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Diagnostic Ultrasound procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the columns
headed with a “P”, and a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H". The technical
component of the procedures subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
In addition to the common elements, the components of Diagnostic Ultrasound procedures include the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect of D that is performed at a place other than the place in which
the procedure is performed.
Note:
1.Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
2.If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B
and C, these may be delegated to another physician.
3.Where the only component provided is interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure,
the specific elements A and C listed for the professional component are included in the
specific elements of the technical component.
For Technical Component H
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure(s).
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s representative,
whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretative report of the procedure to the
referring provider.
G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect of D of the professional
component that is(are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is performed.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for the technical
component H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional
component are submitted using listed fee code with suffix C. (e.g. J102C)
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health
Insurance Act are listed under the column P (use suffix C). Costs for the technical component of
these services are only billable under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act,
2023 and are listed in the Schedule of Facility Costs.
3. A-Mode - implies a one-dimensional ultrasonic measurement procedure.
4. M-Mode - implies a one-dimensional ultrasonic measurement procedure with movement of the
trace to record amplitude and velocity of moving echo-producing structures.
5. Scan B-Mode - implies a two-dimensional ultrasonic scanning procedure with a two-dimensional
display. All ultrasound examinations include a permanent record and interpretative report.
6. If insured diagnostic ultrasound procedures yield abnormal findings or if they would yield
information which in the opinion of the interpreting physician would be insufficient governed by
the needs of the patient and the requirements of the referring provider or practitioner, the
interpreting physician may add further views and claim for them (if listed).
7. All benefits listed apply to unilateral examinations unless otherwise specified. When imaging of
only one anatomical area is requested, comparison ultrasound(s) initiated by the interpreting
physician or facility are not eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
Ultrasound services are not insured when rendered to support in-vitro fertilization services or
artificial insemination services. See Regulation 552 section 24(1) paragraph 23 and 29 under
