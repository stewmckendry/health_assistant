MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM SURGICAL PROCEDURES
Musculoskeletal System Surgical ProceduresMarch 4, 2024 (effective April 1, 2024)
PREAMBLE
A. Corrective splints must be corrective to qualify for a benefit as such. The corrective splint listings
are not applicable to simple immobilization such as with a Jones bandage or metal finger splint
following soft tissue injury.
B. The removal of a wire or pin or other device when used for traction or external fixation (except for
rigid external fixators) in the treatment of a fracture or other orthopaedic procedure is to be included
in the procedural fee (unless otherwise stated in the Schedule) unless a general anaesthetic is
required, in which case a fee may be claimed. Removal of devices used for internal fixation more
than 30 days after insertion may be claimed for in addition to the procedural benefit.
C. The benefit for total joint replacement also includes denervation of the joint, all tenotomies and
division and repair of muscle.
D. The benefit for obtaining a bone graft is not to be claimed in cases of pseudoarthrosis repair,
fusions or for listings in which bone grafting is included.
E. For the supervision of limb fitting and 6 months post-operative care following amputation, claim visit
fees. Amputation with immediate fitting to include supervision of final limb fitting, add 40% (E586).
Note:
Reconstruction or Arthroplasty Procedures: If other procedures are claimed, same joint, same
time, e.g. debridement, synovectomy, tendon release etc., the Medical Consultant will assess
the surgeon's claim.
# E554 - synovectomy requiring a minimum of 30 minutes to resect,
to R236, R240, R241, R244, R281, R288, R436, R437,
R438, R439, R440, R441, R443, R453, R454, R456,

................................................................................... add 175.00
Payment rules:
Synovectomy codes other than E554 are not eligible for payment when rendered in addition to
the codes listed above.
FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS
1. For fractures or dislocations requiring open or closed reduction or no reduction, the major pre-
operative visit, i.e. consultation or appropriate assessment, may be claimed in addition to the
listed benefits.
2. OPEN REDUCTION shall mean the treatment of a fracture and/or dislocation by either closed
intramedullary fixation or by an operative procedure to expose the fracture. The benefits include
fixation by internal or external devices.
3. CLOSED REDUCTION shall mean the reduction of a fracture or dislocation by non-operative
methods (including traction).
4. NO REDUCTION shall mean the treatment of a fracture or dislocation by any other method and
includes the use of the initial external support other than a simple splint. No reduction, rigid
immobilization, means that the device used to achieve a rigid immobilization is custom-molded
and is applied by the physician. In cases involving no reduction, application of a simple splint,
such as a metal splint, is not billable as rigid immobilization (visit fees only apply).

MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM SURGICAL PROCEDURES
PREAMBLE
5. The service includes all related follow-up treatment by the physician for 2 weeks from the date
of treatment of the fracture or dislocation except:
a. for the first and second post-treatment visits to a hospital in-patient;
b. for the subsequent visit by the MRP - day of discharge (C124);
c. for the first post-treatment visit when the patient is no longer a hospital in-patient;
d. if additional reductions are necessary;
e. if the patient is transferred to another surgeon; or
f. if the patient is a paraplegic.
[Commentary:
The first and second post-treatment visits in hospital for 2 weeks from the date of treatment of
the fracture or dislocation are payable at the specialty specific subsequent visit fee.]
6. In multiple fractures or dislocations, the benefit for the major fracture or dislocation shall be
100% and the benefit for the other fractures or dislocations is 85%. When no procedural benefit
is applicable, but that fracture or dislocation necessitates hospitalization or concurrent care over
that demanded by the major injury, a visit benefit may be claimed in addition to other procedural
benefits.
7. For repeat reductions (closed or open) for the same fracture or dislocation, the full benefit
should be claimed for the final reduction and after care; previous reductions by the same
surgeon should be claimed at 85%.
8. Emergency splinting of fractures in the emergency department should be on the basis of
appropriate visit benefit, plus application of cast if appropriate.
9. Transferred cases:
a. When patients are transferred to a chronic or convalescent facility, additional visit benefits on
a chronic care basis shall be allowed to other than the operating surgeon (and also to the
surgeon after 2 weeks).
b. When patients are transferred to another physician for after care of fractures and
dislocations treated by closed or no reduction, the physician rendering the initial care should
claim 75% of the listed fee and the surgeon rendering subsequent care should claim visit
fees except where otherwise specified. In cases involving open reduction, the percentage
should be 80% for the surgeon providing the initial care.
c. In cases where the original physician's attempts to reduce a fracture or dislocation under
general anaesthesia is unsuccessful, and the patient is referred to another physician for
definitive care, the original physician should claim 75% of the listed fee.
10.Pseudoarthrosis repair/reconstruction is only payable when a fracture requires additional
reconstruction because of inadequate healing at least 4 months following the original injury.
Pseudoarthrosis repair/reconstruction includes bone graft, debridement, osteotomy and internal
or external fixation other than the use of an intramedullary nail with distal and proximal locking
screws, or circular external fixation if performed.
11. For fractures and dislocations not requiring reduction, visit fees apply unless a specific fee is
listed. If the listed fee is less than the consultation, the consultation should be claimed under the
fracture/dislocation fee code number.
