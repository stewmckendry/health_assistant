DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY
BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD) MEASUREMENT
H P
Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) - by axial technique only
Definition:
For the purpose of second and subsequent testing,
“high risk patient” means a patient:
1.at risk for accelerated bone loss (in the absence of other risk factors, patient age is deemed
not to place a patient at high risk for accelerated bone loss);
2.with osteopenia or osteoporosis on any previous BMD testing; or
3.with bone loss in excess of 1% per year as demonstrated by previous BMD testing.
“low risk patient” means a patient who is not a high risk patient.
Definition/Required elements of service:
BMD measurement by DXA is an insured service only when all the following conditions have
been met:
1.the service is rendered for the prevention and management of osteoporosis or osteopenia;
2.when more than one site is measured, the sites include both hip and spine and where
measurement of both hip and spine is not technically feasible the site measured consists of
either hip or spine.
[Commentary:
Measurement of hip and spine would be considered not technically feasible due to prosthesis
or deformity.]
Baseline test
X145 - one site............................................................................... 42.85 40.15
X146 - two or more sites ................................................................ 55.20 48.00
Second test - low risk patient
X152 - one site............................................................................... 42.85 40.15
X153 - two or more sites ................................................................ 55.20 48.00
Subsequent test - low risk patient
X142 - one site............................................................................... 42.85 40.15
X148 - two or more sites ................................................................ 55.20 48.00
Subsequent test - high risk patient
X149 - one site............................................................................... 42.85 40.15
X155 - two or more sites ................................................................ 55.20 48.00
Payment rules:
1.Patients are limited to one baseline test (X145 or X146) in their lifetime.
2.Second test - low risk patient (X152/X153) is limited to a maximum of one test rendered not
earlier than 36 months following the baseline test (X145/X146).
3.Subsequent test - low risk patient (X142/X148) is not eligible for payment when rendered
earlier than 60 months following the second or any subsequent test.

4.Any combination of services described by X152 or X153 that were rendered to a patient
between July 1, 2007 and April 1, 2008 for which claims were submitted and paid as insured
services under the Health Insurance Act constitutes, a “second test – low risk patient” for the
purpose of determining service maximums for a second or subsequent test - low risk patient,
and is deemed to have been rendered on July 1, 2010.
5.Any service described by X152 or X153 rendered between April 1, 2008 and July 1, 2010 for
which a claim was submitted and paid as an insured service under the Health Insurance Act
constitutes a subsequent test - low risk patient for the purpose of determining service
maximums for second or subsequent test – low risk patient and is deemed to have been
rendered on July 1, 2010.
6.Subsequent test - high risk patients (X149/X155) is limited to a maximum of one test every 12
months unless the ordering physician obtains written prior authorization from a medical
consultant.
[Commentary:
Authorization will be dependent on the ordering physician demonstrating that the test is
generally accepted as necessary for the patient under the circumstances.]
[Commentary:
1.Baseline, second test and subsequent tests should be ordered only in accordance with
current practice guidelines. In those situations where testing is ordered on a particular patient
for reasons that vary from the guidelines, the ordering physician should ensure that the
patient’s medical record sufficiently explains the justification for the test in this particular
case.
2.In the event a patient with a previous normal baseline test (X145/X146) or second test (X152/
X153) or normal subsequent test – low risk patient (X142/X148) meets any of the criteria
listed for high risk patients as stated above, the patient would be eligible for subsequent test
– high risk patient services (X149/X155) subject to the restriction stated in payment rule #6.
3.The 2002 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Osteoporosis in
Canada (reviewed in 2006) can be found at http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/167/10_suppl/
s1.pdf.
4.Individuals under age 65 without one major or two minor risk factors typically do not benefit
from BMD measurement.]
