GENERAL PREAMBLE
DELEGATED PROCEDURE
Definition:
The term “procedure” as it is used in this section does not include services such as assessments,
consultations, psychotherapy, counselling etc.
Payment rules:
1. Where a procedure is performed by a physician’s employee(s) in the physician’s office, the
service remains insured using the existing fee codes if all the following requirements are met:
a. the procedure is one which is generally and historically accepted as a procedure which may
be carried out by the nurse or other medical assistant in the employ of the physician; and
b. subject to the exceptions set out below, at all times during the procedure, the physician
(although he or she may be otherwise occupied), is:
i. physically present in the office or clinic at which the service is rendered in order to
ensure that procedures are being performed competently; and
ii. available immediately to approve, modify or otherwise intervene in a procedure, as
required, in the best interests of the patient.
2. Exceptions to the requirement for physician presence during the delegated procedure.
Where all of the following conditions are met, the simple office procedures listed in the table
below remain insured despite the physician not being physically present:
a. the non-physician performing the procedure is properly trained to perform the procedure, he/
she reports to the physician, and the procedure is rendered in accordance with accepted
professional standards and practice;
b. the procedure is performed only on the physician’s own patient, as evidenced by either an
ongoing physician/patient relationship or a consultation/assessment rendered by the
physician to the patient on the same day as the procedure is performed; and
c. the same medical record requirements must be met as if the physician personally had
rendered the service. The record must be dated, identify the non-physician performing the
service, and contain a brief note on the procedure performed by the non-physician.
Claims submission instruction:
A locum tenens replacing an absent physician in the absent physician’s office may submit claims for
delegated procedures under either his/her own billing number or the billing number of the physician
he/she is replacing.
