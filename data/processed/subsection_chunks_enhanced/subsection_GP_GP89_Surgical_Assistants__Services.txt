GENERAL PREAMBLE
SURGICAL ASSISTANTS’ SERVICES
CANCELLED SURGERY – ASSISTANT SERVICES
Payment rules:
1. If the procedure is cancelled prior to induction of anaesthesia, the service constitutes a
subsequent hospital visit.
2. When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled due to a complication prior to
commencement of surgery and the assistant has scrubbed but is not required to do anything
further, the service is payable as E006B with the actual number of time units added to 6 basic
units for this service.
[Commentary:
If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced, the amount payable is calculated
by adding the listed procedural basic units plus time units and multiplying the total by the unit
fee listed at the start of this section.]
SECOND ASSISTANT
Payment rules:
When more than one assistant was required for a surgical procedure, unless the service is listed
below, the second assistant’s service is only eligible for payment following authorization by a medical
consultant and requires submission of a letter from the surgeon outlining the reason the second
assistant was required. The amount payable for the second assistant is calculated in the same
manner as the amount payable for the first assistant.
Services where a second assistant's services are payable and authorization is not required:
