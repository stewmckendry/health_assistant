1.Services less than 20 minutes in duration do not constitute any of the services defined in this
section and constitute the type of assessment rendered in the circumstances.
2.Inquiry, discussion or provision of advice or information to a patient, patient’s relative or
representative that would ordinarily constitute part of a consultation, assessment (including
those services which are defined in terms of an assessment) is included as a common or
constituent element of the other service, and does not constitute an interview.]
2. If an appointment for the interview is not separately booked, the amount payable for this service
will be adjusted to a lesser fee.
3. All services described as interviews must be rendered personally by the attending physician or
they become uninsured services.
