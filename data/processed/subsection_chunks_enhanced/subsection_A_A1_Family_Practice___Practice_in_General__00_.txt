a component of the chronic disease shared appointment.
This service has the same specific elements as an assessment.

CASE CONFERENCES
PREAMBLE
Definition/Required elements of service:
Where the conditions set out in this Schedule are met, a case conference is an insured service
despite paragraph 6 of s. 24(1) of Regulation 552. A case conference is a pre-scheduled meeting,
conducted for the purpose of discussing and directing the management of an individual patient. The
required elements are applicable for all case conferences, except in circumstances where these
requirements are modified for specific case conferences, as indicated. A case conference:
a. must be conducted by personal attendance, videoconference or by telephone (or any
combination thereof);
b. must involve at least 2 other participants who meet the eligible participant requirements as
indicated in the specific listed case conference services; and
c. at least one of the physician participants is the physician most responsible for the care of the
patient.
[Commentary:
Case conferences for educational purposes such as rounds, journal club, group learning
sessions, or continuing professional development, or any meeting where the conference is not
for the purpose of discussing and directing the management of an individual patient is not a
case conference.]
For case conferences where the time unit is defined in 10 minute increments, the following payment
rules and medical record requirements are applicable, except in circumstances where these
requirements are modified for specific listed case conference services, as indicated.
Note:
“Regulated social worker” refers to a social worker regulated under the Social Work and Social
Service Work Act and who holds a current certificate of registration from the Ontario College of
Social Workers and Social Service Workers.
Case conferences are time based services calculated in time units of 10 minute increments. In
calculating time unit(s), the minimum time required is based upon consecutive time spent participating
in the case conference as follows:
# Units Minimum time
1 unit 10 minutes
2 units 16 minutes
3 units 26 minutes
