General PreambleMarch 4, 2024 (effective April 1, 2024)
INTRODUCTION
[Commentary:
The Health Insurance Act and, to a lesser extent, the Integrated Community Health Services
Centres Act, 2023 and the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004, provide the legal
foundation and framework for the Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services (“the Schedule”).
The Schedule lists services insured by OHIP and includes the General Preamble (which
impacts all physicians), Consultations and Visits section (which applies to all specialties) and
specific system and/or specialty sections (including specialty preambles).
The General Preamble provides details about billing requirements for all physicians as follows:
The initial Definitions Section (GP2) begins with general definitions of key terms and phrases
used in the Schedule. Those terms and phrases are italicized throughout the General Preamble
as an indication that further information is available in the Definitions Section. The second
group of defined terms refers specifically to maximums, minimums, and time or unit-based
services.
The information provided in the General Information Section (GP8) is the foundation for the
remainder of the General Preamble. A variety of subjects are reviewed as detailed in the table
of contents. This is followed by the Constituent and Common Elements of Insured Services
(GP13). Next is the section which lists the Specific Elements of Assessments (GP15). The
next section provides information on Consultations and Assessments (GP16) followed by
the section regarding services provided only in Hospitals and Other Institutions (GP40).
The next section focuses on psychotherapy, counselling, and related services, followed by a
similar review of services that involve interviews. The remaining sections include special visits,
surgical assistants’ services, anaesthesiologists’ services, and others as listed in the table of
contents.]

MAXIMUMS, MINIMUMS AND TIME OR UNIT-BASED SERVICES
In this Schedule when the amount payable for a service is described:
a. In terms of a maximum number of services without reference to a specific time period to
which the maximum applies, this means that the maximum refers to a maximum number of
services per patient per day. Those services rendered to the same patient on the same day
in excess of the maximum for that patient on that day are not eligible for payment.
b. In terms of a maximum number of services with reference to a specific time period to which
the maximum applies, the services are calculated per patient and the number of services is
based upon services rendered chronologically. Those services rendered to the same patient
during that specific time period in excess of the maximum for that patient are not eligible for
payment.
c. In terms of a maximum with reference to a specific part of the anatomy, this means a
maximum number of services per patient per day. Those services rendered in excess of the
maximum for that specific part of the anatomy per patient on that day are not eligible for
payment.
d. In terms of a minimum number of services without reference to a specific time period to
which the minimum applies, this means that the minimum refers to a minimum number of
services per patient per day. With the exception of those services listed in the “Diagnostic
Radiology” section of the Schedule or unless specifically stated otherwise, where less than
the number of services required to satisfy the minimum are rendered, the services are not
eligible for payment.
e. In terms of “repeat” or “repeats”, except with respect to repeat consultations or unless
otherwise stated, this means the same service(s) is rendered to the same patient by the
same physician on the same day.
f. In terms of a minimum required duration of time, the physician must record on the patient’s
permanent medical record or chart the time when the insured service started and ended. If
the patient’s permanent medical record or chart does not include this required information,
the service is not eligible for payment.
g. Based upon the number of “units” of service rendered, the physician must record on the
patient’s permanent medical record or chart the time when the insured service started and
ended. If the patient’s permanent medical record or chart does not include this required
information, the service is not eligible for payment.

GENERAL PREAMBLE
GENERAL INFORMATION
[Commentary: Services Insured by OHIP
The Schedule is established under section 37.1 of regulation 552 under the Act. The fees listed
are the amounts payable by OHIP for insured services. Insured services under the Act are
limited to those which are listed in this Schedule, medically necessary, are not otherwise
excluded by legislation or regulation, and are rendered personally by physicians or by others
delegated to perform them where such delegation is authorized in accordance with the
Schedule requirements for delegated services.
Some services are specifically listed as uninsured in regulation 552, section 24 of the Act (see
Appendix A), such as a service that is solely for the purpose of altering or restoring
appearance. Other services may be uninsured depending on the circumstances. An example
of a service which is uninsured in limited circumstances is psychotherapy, which is uninsured
where it is a requirement for the patient to obtain a diploma or degree or to fulfill a course of
study. Other examples of commonly uninsured services include missed appointments or
procedures, circumcision except if medically necessary, and certain services rendered and
documents and forms completed in connection with non-medically necessary requests (e.g. life
insurance application).]
[Commentary: Modifications to the Schedule
Under agreement between the MOH and the OMA, additions, deletions, fee changes, or other
modifications to the Schedule, are made by the MOH following consultation and/or negotiation
with the OMA. Physicians who wish to have modifications to the Schedule considered should
submit any proposals to the Physician Payment Committee (PPC) through the appropriate
clinical section of the OMA.
In the situation where a new therapy or procedure is being introduced into Ontario, and the
physicians performing the new therapy or procedure wish to have a new fee item inserted into
the Schedule, the following process is recommended.
An application for a new fee related to the new therapy or procedure should be submitted by
the appropriate section(s) of the OMA to the PPC for consideration, with documentation
supporting the introduction of this item into the Schedule. The PPC will advise OHIP whether or
not this new therapy is experimental. If the PPC and the MOH agree that the item is
experimental, the service is deemed uninsured (in accordance with section 24 of regulation
552 under the Act), and will not be introduced into the Schedule. If the MOH, on the advice of
the PPC, determines that the new therapy or procedure is not experimental, the fee application
will be handled in the usual manner as detailed above.]
[Commentary: Medical Research
Examinations or procedures for the purpose of a research or survey program are not insured
services, nor are services provided by a laboratory or a hospital that support an examination or
procedure that is for the purpose of research or a survey. The exception to this is that an
assessment conducted to determine if an insured person is suitable for such a program is not
necessarily an uninsured service (see section 24 of regulation 552 under the Act - this is
provided as Appendix A of the Schedule).]
[Commentary: Medical Records
All insured services must be documented in appropriate records. The Act requires that the
record establish that:
1.an insured service was provided;
2.the service for which the account is submitted is the service that was rendered; and
3.the service was medically necessary.
The medical record requirements as found in the Act are listed in Appendix G of the Schedule.]

GENERAL INFORMATION
GENERAL PAYMENT RULES
[Commentary:
Claims for payment must be submitted to OHIP in the form and by the medium (e.g. electronic
data transmission; machine readable input) as set out in sections 38.3 to 38.5 of regulation 552
under the Act and must contain the information required by the regulation and the General
Manager of OHIP. Regulation 552 under the Act can be found at:
http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Regs/English/900552_e.htm.
Claims must be submitted within three months of the date the service was rendered, except in
extenuating circumstances. A claim cannot be accepted for payment unless it meets all of the
technical and formal requirements set out in the Act and regulations.]
1. The fee is payable only to the physician who rendered the service personally, or by the
physician whose delegate rendered the service where delegation is authorized in accordance
with the Schedule.
2. Where more than one physician renders different components of a listed service, only one fee is
payable for that service, and the fee is payable only where the Schedule provides that different
physicians may perform different components of the service.
[Commentary:
Where an insured service contains several components (e.g. surgical procedures that include
post-operative care or fracture care), the components of the service are not divisible among
physicians for claims purposes and the physicians are responsible for apportioning payment
amongst themselves.]
3. Where the Schedule provides that different physicians may substitute for one another in
performing the total service, only one fee is payable for the service.
[Commentary:
When physicians routinely or frequently substitute for each other in providing hospital visits to
registered bed patients in active treatment hospitals, e.g. weekend coverage or daily rounds by
various members of a group, the most responsible physician may claim for all the visits.]
Specialist services
When a service rendered by a specialist comprises part of an insured consultation or assessment that
falls within the scope of his or her specialist practice, the service is not eligible for payment unless the
claim for the service is submitted either:
a. unless otherwise noted, in respect of a service described in the portions of the Consultations
and Visits section of this Schedule that reflects the physician’s Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Canada specialty, as documented in the records maintained by the MOH
for claims payment purposes; or
b. in respect of a service described in this Schedule under the following sub-headings which
can be claimed by any specialty: psychotherapy, counselling, HIV primary care, palliative
care support, hypnotherapy, certification of mental illness, interviews, genetic assessments,
midwife or aboriginal midwife-requested emergency and special emergency assessments,
home care application, or home care supervision.

GENERAL PREAMBLE
GENERAL INFORMATION
When a service rendered by a specialist does not fall within the scope of the specialist’s practice and/
or the specialist is providing primary care in a family or general practice setting, the service is only
eligible for payment when the claim is submitted using the appropriate code from the “Family Practice
& Practice in General” listings.
When more than one assessment is rendered to a patient during the same visit by the same physician
who is qualified in one or more specialties, only one assessment is payable.
[Commentary:
Any additional assessment is not eligible for payment.]
Use of Codes, Prefixes and Suffixes
[Commentary:
Services are generally, but not necessarily, listed by anatomical system or specialty for
convenience.]
The alpha-numeric fee code opposite the service listing in this Schedule must be set out in the claim
submitted, together with the required suffix.
Surgical Codes: In the surgical part of the Schedule, the required suffixes are:
suffix A if the physician performs the procedure;
suffix B if the physician assisted at the surgery; and
suffix C if the physician administered the anaesthetic.

Diagnostic Services Rendered at a Hospital
The technical component of those diagnostic services that are listed with "technical component" or in
a column headed "H" or "T" is not eligible for payment if the service is rendered to a patient who:
1. is an in-patient of a hospital; or
2. attends a hospital where he or she receives an insured diagnostic service; and
3. within 24 hours of receiving that diagnostic service, is admitted to the same hospital as an in-
patient in connection with the same condition, illness, injury or disease in relation to which the
diagnostic service was rendered.
[Commentary:
1.For those diagnostic services which have both technical and professional components listed
under one fee schedule code, the technical and professional components are claimed
separately. The claim for the technical component is submitted using the fee schedule code

Consultation and Assessment Codes
There are four different prefixes used for consultations and assessments listed in the “Consultations
and Visits” section of the Schedule. The codes with the “A” prefix are described as the “General
Listings”. These must be used when submitting a claim for consultations and assessments except in
the following situations when the code listed below must be used:
1. acute care hospital – non-emergency in-patient services – “C” prefix codes;
2. long term care institution – non-emergency in-patient services – “W” prefix codes;
3. emergency department – services rendered by a physician on duty – “H” prefix (H1- codes); or
4. rehabilitation unit – services rendered by a specialist in Physical Medicine – “H” prefix codes
(H3XX codes)
[Commentary:
Submit claim using an “A” prefix assessment when an assessment is rendered in conjunction
with a special visit premium. Information regarding when special visit premiums are payable is
found on pages GP65 to GP78 of the General Preamble.]
Independent Consideration (IC)
Services listed in the Schedule without specified fees are identified as “IC” and are given independent
consideration by the medical consultant. Claims for such services must be submitted with a
supporting letter explaining the amount of the fee claimed, and must include an appropriate operative
or consultation report, and a comparison of the scope and difficulty of the procedure in relation to non-
IC procedures in the Schedule. For treatment of tumours not listed in the Schedule, surgeons must
use the IC code, R993, and for surgical procedures not listed, but similar to a listed service, the code,
R990.

CONSTITUENT AND COMMON ELEMENTS OF INSURED SERVICES
[Commentary:
This Schedule identifies the constituent elements that comprise insured services. Common
elements apply to all insured services and specific elements apply to specific groups of
services where identified either in the General Preamble or in the preamble to a specific
system and/or specialty sections of the Schedule. There may be additional specific
requirements (“required elements of service”, “payment rules”, “claims submission instructions”
or “notes”) for some individual services, and these are noted with the description of any such
service within the Schedule. In order to determine the correct claim to use for a service
rendered, the necessary information is found by reviewing the common elements, specific
elements, and service specific information.
No charges may be made (except to OHIP) for an insured service rendered to an insured
person or for any of the constituent elements of such insured services. This is prohibited by the
Act and/or the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004.
Most services include as a constituent element of the service the provision of the premises,
equipment, supplies, and personnel used in the performance of the common and specific
elements of the service. This is not, however, the case for services denoted by codes marked
with the prefix “#”, and for services that are divided into professional and technical components
where only the professional component is an insured service under the Act.
For those codes denoted with the prefix “#” and performed in a hospital, the premises,
equipment, supplies, and personnel used to perform all elements of the service are funded by
the hospital global budget.
For those services denoted with the prefix “#” and provided in an Integrated Community Health
Services Centre (ICHSC), the premises, equipment, supplies, and personnel are funded under
the facility costs set out in the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.
Patients cannot be charged for the premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for services
denoted with the prefix “#” rendered outside of a hospital or ICHSC if the premises, equipment,
supplies and personnel support, assist or provide a necessary adjunct to an insured service
denoted with the prefix “#” as charging a patient would be contrary to the Integrated
Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.]
COMMON ELEMENTS OF INSURED SERVICES
All insured services include the skill, time, and responsibility involved in performing, including when
delegated to a non-physician in accordance with the Delegated Procedures Section (GP62) of the
General Preamble, supervising the performance of the constituent elements of the service.
Unless otherwise specifically listed in the Schedule, the following elements are common to all insured
services.
A. Being available to provide follow-up insured services to the patient and arranging for coverage
when not available.
B. Making arrangements for appointment(s) for the insured service.
C. Travelling to and from the place(s) where any element(s) of the service is (are) performed.
[Commentary:
Travelling to visit an insured person outside of the usual geographical area of practice of the
person making the visit is an uninsured service – see Regulation 552 section 24(1) paragraph
1 under the Act.]

H. Preparing or submitting documents or records, or providing information for use in programs
administered by the MOH.
I. Conferring with or providing advice, direction, information, or records to physicians and other
professionals associated with the health and development of the patient.
J. Such planning, preparation, and administration for the performance of the elements of the service
directly attributable either to a specific patient or to a physician maintaining his/her practice, unless
otherwise specifically listed in the Schedule.

professional and technical components where only the professional component is an insured
service under the Act, providing premises, equipment, supplies, and personnel for the common
elements of the service.
L. Waiting times associated with the provision of the service(s).
While no occasion may arise for performing elements A, B, C, D, F, G, H or K when performed in
connection with the specific elements of a service, these are included in the service.

SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF ASSESSMENTS
In addition to the common elements, all services which are described as assessments, or as including
assessments (e.g. consultations), include the following specific elements:
A. A direct physical encounter with the patient including taking a patient history and performing a
physical examination.
B. Other inquiry (including taking a patient history), carried out to arrive at an opinion as to the nature
of the patient’s condition, (whether such inquiry takes place before, during or after the encounter
during which the physical examination takes place) and/or follow-up care.
C. Performing any procedure(s) during the same encounter as the physical examination, unless the
procedure(s) is(are) separately listed in the Schedule and an amount is payable for the procedure
in conjunction with an assessment.
“Procedure” in this context includes obtaining specimens, preparation of the patient, interpretation
of results and, unless otherwise specified, all diagnostic (including laboratory) and therapeutic
(including surgical) services;
D. Making arrangements for any related assessments, procedures or therapy, and/or interpreting
results.
E. Making arrangements for follow-up care.
F. Discussion with, and providing advice and information, including prescribing therapy to the patient
or the patient’s representative, whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to:
1. the service; and
2. in circumstances in which it would be professionally appropriate that results can be reported
upon prior to any further patient visit, the results of related procedure(s) and/or assessment(s).
G. When medically indicated, monitoring the condition of the patient and intervening, until the next
insured service is provided.
H. Providing premises, equipment, supplies, and personnel for the specific elements of the service
except for any aspect(s) that is (are) performed in a hospital or nursing home.
While no occasion may arise for performing elements C, D, E, G, or H, when performed in connection
with the other specific elements, they are included in the assessment.

CONSULTATIONS
CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A consultation is an assessment rendered following a written request from a referring:
1. physician
2. nurse practitioner or
3. dental surgeon in connection with an insured dental procedure rendered in a hospital,
who, in light of his/her professional knowledge of the patient, requests the opinion of a physician (the
“consultant physician”) competent to give advice in this field because of the complexity, seriousness,
or obscurity of the case, or because another opinion is requested by the patient or patient’s
representative.
[Commentary:
1.The referring physician, nurse practitioner or dental surgeon must determine if multiple
requests by a patient or the patient’s representative to different physicians in the same
specialty for the same condition are medically necessary. Services that are not medically
necessary are uninsured.
2.If the physician rendering the service requests a referring physician, nurse practitioner or
dental surgeon to submit a consultation request for that service after the service has been
provided, a consultation is not payable. The visit fee appropriate to the service rendered may
be claimed.
3. Where a physician who has been paid for a consultation for the patient for the same
diagnosis makes a request for a referral for ongoing management of the patient, the service
rendered following the referral is not payable as a consultation, except as outlined in the
Virtual Care Services section under definitions, part 3, commentary 3]
A consultation includes the services necessary to enable the consultant to prepare a written report
(including findings, opinions, and recommendations) to the referring physician, nurse practitioner or
dental surgeon. Where the referral is made by a nurse practitioner, the consultant shall provide the
report to the nurse practitioner and the patient’s primary care provider, if applicable. Except where
otherwise specified, the consultant is required to perform a general, specific or medical specific
assessment, including a review of all relevant data.
The following are additional requirements for a consultation:
a. A copy of the written request for the consultation, signed by the referring physician, nurse
practitioner or dental surgeon must be kept in the consulting physician’s medical record,
except in the case of a consultation which occurs in a hospital, long-term care institution or
multi-specialty clinic where common medical records are maintained. In such cases, the
written request may be contained on the common medical record.
b. The request identifies the consultant by name, the referring physician, nurse practitioner or
dental surgeon by name and billing number, and identifies the patient by name and health
number.
c. The written request sets out the information relevant to the referral and specifies the
service(s) required.
In the event these requirements are not met, the amount payable for a consultation will be reduced to
a lesser assessment fee.

[Commentary:
The request would ordinarily also include appropriate clinical information, such as the reason
for the referral for consultation, present and past history, physical findings and relevant test
results and reports.]
Payment rules:
1. Consultations rendered to the same patient by the same physician for the same diagnosis are
limited to one service per two consecutive 12 month periods except:
a. When the additional consultation service(s) is a repeat consultation;

CONSULTATIONS
REPEAT CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A repeat consultation is an additional consultation rendered by the same consultant, in respect of the
same presenting problem, following care rendered to the patient by another physician in the interval
following the initial consultation but preceding the repeat consultation.
A repeat consultation has the same requirements as a consultation including the requirement for a
new written request by the referring physician, nurse practitioner or dental surgeon.
LIMITED CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A limited consultation is a consultation which is less demanding and, in terms of time, normally
requires substantially less of the physician’s time than the full consultation. Otherwise, a limited
consultation has the same requirements as a full consultation.
Under the heading of “Family Practice & Practice in General", a limited consultation is the service
rendered by any physician who is not a specialist, where the service meets all the requirements for a
consultation but, because of the nature of the referral, only those services which constitute a specific
assessment are rendered.
EMERGENCY ROOM (ER) PHYSICIAN CONSULTATION
Payment rules:
1. The amount payable for a consultation by an ER Physician will be adjusted to a lesser
assessment fee under either of the following circumstances:
a. the patient is referred by another ER physician in the same hospital; or
b. the service is rendered in any location other than the emergency department or other critical
care area in a hospital, or to a critically ill patient in a hospital.
2. ER reports constitute adequate documentation of the written report of the consultation as long
as the rendering of all constituent elements is clearly documented on all copies of the report. If
the consulting physician fails to ensure that a copy of the ER report is sent to the physician or
nurse practitioner who referred the patient, the amount payable for the service will be adjusted
to the amount payable for an assessment.
Claims submission instruction:
Claims for ER Physician consultations are to be submitted using H055 for a specialist in emergency
medicine (FRCP) and H065 for all other physicians.
SPECIAL SURGICAL CONSULTATION
Definition/Required elements of service:
A special surgical consultation is rendered when a surgeon provides all the appropriate elements of a
regular consultation and is required to devote at least fifty minutes exclusively to the consultation with
the patient.
[Commentary:
The calculation of the 50 minute minimum excludes time devoted to any other service or
procedure for which an amount is payable in addition to the consultation.]

[Commentary:
An example of an 18 month age-appropriate developmental screen would be that outlined in
the Rourke Baby Record and an example of a brief standardized tool completed by the parent/
guardian, legal representative or other caregiver that aids the identification of children at risk of
a developmental disorder would be the Nipissing District Developmental Screen or similar

E-Assessments
Definition/Required elements of service:
An e-assessment is a service performed by a specialist when a primary care physician or nurse
practitioner requests an opinion and/or recommendations from the specialist for management of a
specific patient by providing information electronically through a secure server (e.g. secure
messaging, EMR). The specialist is required to review all relevant data provided by the primary care
physician or nurse practitioner, including the review of any additional information that may be
submitted subsequent to the initial request. For the purpose of this service, “relevant data” may
include family/patient history, history of the presenting complaint, laboratory and diagnostic tests, and
visual images where indicated.
In addition to the Common Elements, E-assessments include the specific elements of assessments,
as listed in the General Preamble, except for paragraphs A and B.
Payment rules:
1.E-assessments are only eligible for payment if the specialist has provided an opinion and/or
recommendations for patient management to the primary care physician or nurse practitioner
within 30 days from the date of the request. Where a service is requested by a nurse
practitioner the consultant shall provide the report to the nurse practitioner and the patient’s
primary care provider, if applicable.
2.E-assessments are not eligible for payment to the specialist in the following circumstances
a.when the purpose of the electronic communication is to arrange for transfer of the
patient’s care to any physician; or
b.when rendered in whole or in part to arrange for a consultation, a different assessment,
visit, or K-prefix time-based services, procedure(s), or diagnostic investigation(s); or
c.when the specialist renders a K-prefix time-based service for the same patient within 30
days following the request for the specialist e-assessment; or
d.in circumstances where the primary care physician or specialist receives compensation,
other than by fee-for service under this Schedule, for participation in the e-assessment.
3.A consultation, a different assessment or visit rendered by the specialist for the same patient
for the same diagnosis within 60 days following the request for the specialist e-assessment is
only payable as a specific or partial assessment, as appropriate to the service rendered.
4.K738 is eligible for payment to the primary care physician when this physician is required to
collect additional data (for example dermatology or ophthalmology images not present in the
primary care physician’s records) to support the specialist’s e-assessment. K738 is not
eligible for payment where existing data is already available in the primary care physician’s
records for submission to the specialist.
[Commentary:
1.Following the primary care physician’s request, the specialist decides whether an e-
assessment is the most appropriate service in the circumstances. In some cases, direct
patient contact or a consultation by videoconference may be more appropriate.
2.Payment, other than by fee-for-service, includes compensation where the physician receives
remuneration under a salary, primary care, stipend, APP or AFP model.
3.Physicians who receive compensation other than by fee-for-service under this Schedule
should consult their contract for guidance on shadow-billing.]

Definition/Required elements of service:
Initial e-assessment is the first e-assessment performed by a particular specialist that is requested by
the primary care physician or nurse practitioner for a specific patient and diagnosis where the
specialist must review all relevant data provided by the primary care physician and provide a written
opinion that includes a diagnosis and/or management advice to the primary care physician or nurse
practitioner.
[Commentary:
The time and intensity of this service is the same as a regular consultation. The specialist may
choose to return their opinion by phone, however, a written opinion must be provided
electronically or by mail.]
Payment rules:
Initial e-assessments are limited to a maximum of one per patient per specialist per 12 month
period unless the primary care physician or nurse practitioner makes a second request in
relation to a complaint for which a clearly different diagnosis is made, unrelated to the
diagnosis made at the time of the first e-assessment in that same 12 month period, in which
case the limit is increased to a maximum of two per patient per specialist per 12 month period.
[Commentary:
If a subsequent e-assessment is related to the diagnosis made at the time of the initial e-
assessment, then this service is payable as a repeat e-assessment, follow-up e-assessment or
minor e-assessment as appropriate to the service rendered.]
repeat E-ASSESSMENT
Definition/ Required elements of service:
Repeat e-assessment is the first e-assessment performed by a particular specialist following an initial
e-assessment or consultation by that specialist that is requested by the primary care physician or
nurse practitioner for the same diagnosis where the specialist must review all relevant data provided
by the primary care physician or nurse practitioner and provide an opinion that includes management
advice to the primary care physician or nurse practitioner.
[Commentary:
The time and intensity of this service is the same as a specific assessment. The specialist may
choose to return their opinion by phone.]
Payment rules:
Repeat e-assessments are limited to a maximum of one per patient per physician per 12 month
period unless the primary care physician or nurse practitioner makes a second request in
relation to a complaint for which a clearly different diagnosis is made, unrelated to the
diagnosis made at the time of the first e- assessment in that same 12 month period, in which
case the limit is increased to a maximum of two per patient per physician per 12 month period.

has previously rendered any insured service to the patient for the same diagnosis. The specialist must
review all relevant information submitted and provide an opinion and/or management advice to the
primary care physician or nurse practitioner.
[Commentary:
The time and intensity of the service is the same as a partial assessment. The specialist may
choose to return their opinion by phone.]
Payment rules:
Follow-up e-assessment is limited to a maximum of:
1.one (1) service per patient per day, same physician;
2.four (4) services per patient same physician per 12 month period; and

MINOR E-ASSESSMENT
Definition/ Required elements of service:
A minor e-assessment is a brief e-assessment rendered by the specialist. The specialist must review
all relevant information submitted and provide an answer to the primary care physician’s or nurse
practitioner’s specific clinical question.
Payment rules:
Minor e-assessment is limited to a maximum of:
1.one (1) service per patient per day, same physician;
2.twelve (12) services per patient same physician per 12 month period; and
3.two thousand (2000) services per physician per 12 month period.
[Commentary:
A minor e-assessment is where the primary care physician or nurse practitioner may ask a
specific question related to the patient where the information provided is limited and the
question asked is very specific. An example is where the primary care physician has initiated a
treatment recommended by the specialist, and the primary care physician requests a brief
email response related to proper dosing adjustments. One service may include multiple emails.
The specialist may choose to return their opinion by phone.]

A. Admission Assessment – General Requirements
Definition:
a. An admission assessment is the initial assessment of the patient rendered for the purpose
of admitting a patient to hospital.
b. The admitting physician is the physician who renders the admission assessment.
Payment rules:
1. Except as outlined below in paragraph 3, when the admitting physician has not previously
assessed the patient for the same presenting illness within 90 days of the admission
assessment, the admission assessment constitutes a consultation, general or medical specific
or specific assessment depending on the specialty of the physician, the nature of the service
rendered and any applicable payment rules.
2. Except as outlined below in paragraph 3, if the admitting physician has previously assessed the
patient for the same presenting illness within 90 days of the admission assessment, the
admission assessment constitutes a general re-assessment or specific re-assessment
depending on the specialty of the physician, the nature of the service rendered and any
applicable payment rules.
3. When a hospital in-patient is transferred from one physician to another physician, only one
consultation, general or specific assessment or reassessment is eligible for payment
per patient admission. The amount eligible for payment for services in excess of this limit will be
adjusted to a lesser assessment fee. An additional admission assessment is not eligible for
payment when a hospital inpatient is transferred from one physician to another physician within
the same hospital.
Admission Assessments by Specialists:
When a patient has been assessed by a specialist in the emergency room (ER) or out-patient
department (OPD) and that physician renders a service described as a consultation, specific
assessment, or medical specific assessment and subsequently admits the patient to hospital, the
initial consultation, specific, or medical specific assessment constitutes the admission assessment.
When a patient has been assessed by a specialist in the ER or OPD, and that physician renders any
other assessment other than those listed in the paragraph immediately above, and that physician
subsequently admits the patient to hospital, an admission assessment is eligible for payment in
addition to the initial assessment, if each service is rendered separately.
[Commentary:
In accordance with the surgical preamble, a hospital admission assessment by the surgeon is
not eligible for payment, unless it is the “major pre-operative visit” (i.e., the consultation or
assessment which may be claimed when the decision to operate is made and the operation is

B. Subsequent Visit
Definition:
A subsequent visit is any routine assessment in hospital following the hospital admission assessment.
Attendance at Surgery: If, in the interest of the patient, the referring physician is asked to be
present by the patient or the patient’s representative, but does not assist at the procedure, the
attendance at surgery by the referring physician constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.
Multidisciplinary care: Except where a single service for a team of physicians is listed in this
Schedule (e.g. the weekly team fee for dialysis), when the complexity of the medical condition
requires the services of several physicians in different disciplines, each physician visit
constitutes a subsequent visit.
Payment rules:
1. Except in the circumstances outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3, or when a patient is referred from
one physician to another (see Claims submission instruction below), subsequent visits are
limited to one per patient, per day for the first 5 weeks after admission, 3 visits per week from 6
to 13 weeks after admission, and 6 visits per month after 13 weeks. Services in excess of the
limit are not eligible for payment.
2. After 5 weeks of hospitalization, any assessment in hospital required as a result of an acute
intercurrent illness in excess of the weekly or monthly limits set out above constitutes C121 –
“additional visit due to intercurrent illness”. The weekly or monthly limits set out above do not
apply to additional visits due to intercurrent illness.
3. Pediatric subsequent visits (C262) are limited to one per patient, per day for the duration of the
admission.
4. When a physician is already in the hospital and assesses one of his/her own patients or patients
transferred to his/her care, the service constitutes a subsequent visit. If a physician assesses
another physician’s patient on an emergency basis, the General Listings (“A” prefix) apply.
Claims submission instruction:
When a hospital in-patient is referred from one physician to another physician, the date the second
physician assessed the patient for the first time is considered the “admission date” for the purposes of
determining the appropriate subsequent visit fee code.
[Commentary:
When a hospital in-patient is transferred from one physician to another physician, subsequent
visits by the second physician are calculated based on the actual admission date of the
patient.]

SPECIAL VISIT PREMIUMS
Special visit means a visit initiated by a patient or an individual on behalf of the patient for the purpose
of rendering a non-elective service or, if rendered in the patient's home, a non-elective or elective
service.
A special visit premium is payable in respect of a special visit rendered to an insured person, subject
to the conditions and limitations set out below. All special visit premiums are subject to the maximums,
limitations and conditions set out in the "Special Visit Premium Table" applicable in the circumstances.
Payment rules:
1.Special visit premiums are only eligible for payment when rendered with certain services
listed under "Consultations and Visits" and "Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures"
sections of this Schedule.
2.Regardless of the time of day at which the service is rendered, special visit premiums are not
eligible for payment in the following circumstances:
a.for patients seen during rounds at a hospital or long-term care institution (including a
nursing home or home for the aged);
b.in conjunction with admission assessments of patients who have been admitted to
hospital on an elective basis;
c.for non-referred or transferred obstetrical patients except, in the case of transferred
obstetrical patients for a special visit for obstetrical delivery with sacrifice of office hours
for the first patient seen (C989);
d.for services rendered in a place, other than a hospital or long-term care facility, that is
scheduled to be open for the purpose of diagnosing or treating patients;

routine or ordinary office hours even if held at night or on weekends or holidays.
3.Special visit premiums are not eligible for payment with services described by emergency
department "H" prefix fee codes.
[Commentary:
For elective home visits rendered during daytime, evenings, nights or weekends, submit
claim(s) using fee codes found under the column titled "Elective Home Visit" of Special Visit
Premium Table VI listed on page GP75.]
Sacrifice of office hours means an insured service rendered when the demands of the patient and/or
the patient's condition are such that the physician makes a previously unscheduled non-elective visit
to the patient at a time when the physician had an office visit booked with one or more patients but,
because of the previously unscheduled non-elective visit, any such office visit was delayed or
cancelled.

PREMIUMS
[Commentary:
Special visit premiums are in respect of either or both: a "travel premium" and a "patient seen"
premium (i.e. "first person seen premium" or "an additional person seen premium").]
A. Travel Premium
Definition/required elements of service:
A travel premium is only eligible for payment for travel from one location to another location ("the
destination") subject to the payment rules below.
A travel premium is not eligible for payment when a physician is required to travel from one location to
another within the same long-term care facility, hospital complex or within buildings situated on the
same hospital campus.
[Commentary:
1.A first person seen premium may be eligible for payment in this circumstance.
2.Only one travel premium is eligible for payment for each separate trip to a destination
regardless of the number of patients seen in association with each trip.]
B. First person seen premium
A first person seen premium is eligible for payment for the first person seen at the destination under
one of the following circumstances ("the eligible times"):
1. if the insured service is commenced evenings (17:00 hr-24:00 hr) Monday to Friday; daytime or
evenings on Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays; or nights (24:00 hr-07:00 hr);
2. if rendered requiring sacrifice of office hours; or
3. if rendered during daytime hours (07:00 - 17:00 hrs Monday through Friday) in circumstances in
which a travel premium is eligible for payment.
C. Additional person premium
An additional person premium is only eligible for payment for services rendered at the destination to
additional patients seen in emergency departments, outpatient departments, long-term care
institutions or to hospital inpatients, provided that each additional patient service is commenced
during the eligible times.
[Commentary:
Special visit premiums are not eligible for payment for elective services rendered at a long-term
care institution, including a nursing home or home for the aged, even when the long-term care
institution is the "home" of the patient.
Submit claims for routine elective visits in these locations as subsequent visits. For example, if
the physician is called to a nursing home to see a patient for a non-elective problem at 8AM,
and subsequently sees his/her routine patients on rounds, those additional patients do not
qualify for the additional person premium.]

restrictions which apply to special visit premiums for services rendered in the emergency department
by Emergency Department Physicians (as defined above). These limits are listed in the Special Visit

SUPERVISION OF POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL TRAINEES
[Commentary:
1.A physician who supervises a medical trainee who renders an insured service is eligible to
be paid for the insured service as if the supervising physician performed the service
personally, subject to any terms, conditions and limitations found in this section.
2.The sole purpose of the terms and conditions described in this section is to define when a
service is payable by OHIP. These terms and conditions do not alter the College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario Professional Responsibilities in Postgraduate Medical
Education requirements or any requirements of the institutions responsible for postgraduate
medical education.]
Note:
Unless otherwise specified in this section, all other payment requirements in the Schedule
related to any service that is performed by a Medical Trainee are applicable.
DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this section of the Schedule only, the following Definitions apply:
Supervision: Supervision is performed by the Supervising Physician and includes the
responsibility to guide, observe and assess the educational activities of
the Medical Trainee and assures the quality of an insured service while
being rendered by the Medical Trainee.
Supervision is only performed:
a. in person, by telephone, or videoconference, the method being consistent with the acuity of
the service being rendered by the Medical Trainee as well as the Medical Trainee’s level of
competence;
b. when the service is provided within a setting approved by the educational institution where
the Medical Trainee is registered; and
c. when the service is within the scope and oversight of the postgraduate medical training
program in which the Medical Trainee is registered.
[Commentary:
The Supervising Physician and the Medical Trainee must be physically present in Ontario.]
Supervising The Supervising Physician is a physician who performs Supervision of a
Physician Medical Trainee who renders an insured service to an insured person.
The Supervising Physician must hold an academic appointment with the
educational institution where the Medical Trainee is registered. The
Supervising Physician of a Medical Trainee involved in the care of a
patient may or may not be the most responsible physician for that
patient.

SUPERVISION OF POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL TRAINEES
Payment Rules
A. GENERAL
1. A service rendered by a Medical Trainee is only eligible for payment to the Supervising
Physician where Supervision is provided as defined above and subject to the specific
requirements below.
2. Where a Resident with an OHIP billing number is providing insured services independently and
outside their training program, the insured service is not eligible for payment to a Supervising
Physician as there is no Supervision provided.
[Commentary:
In the scenario described above the Resident is not performing the service as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Resident would bill OHIP for the service provided.]
3. Where a Clinical Fellow with an OHIP billing number is providing insured services
independently and outside their training program, the insured service is not eligible for payment
to a Supervising Physician as there is no Supervision provided.
[Commentary:
In the scenario described above the Clinical Fellow is not performing the services as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Clinical Fellow would bill OHIP for the services provided. For
example, an orthopedic surgeon may be enrolled in a sarcoma surgery clinical fellowship but
has privileges as a general orthopedic surgeon and may perform, and be eligible for payment,
for rendering a service such as an open reduction of a fracture that is not being supervised by
a Supervising Physician.]
4. Special Visit premiums are not eligible for payment to the Supervising Physician unless the
Supervising Physician personally satisfies the payment requirements for a special visit
premium.
5. The following services are not eligible for payment to the Supervising Physician when rendered
by a Medical Trainee:
a. Case Conferences;
b. Multidisciplinary Cancer Conferences;

c. is immediately available to personally attend the patient when requested by the Resident or
other health care professional.

service concurrently, only the time units rendered by one Medical Trainee are eligible for
payment to the same Supervising Physician.]
D. NUMBER OF MEDICAL TRAINEES
The following table describes the maximum number of services that are payable for services rendered
concurrently by Medical Trainee(s) and the Supervising Physician.

E. Forms
1. An insured service listed in the Schedule that includes the completion of a form is not eligible for
payment to a Supervising Physician if rendered by a Medical Trainee unless the form has been
reviewed and signed by the Supervising Physician.
F. Medical Record Requirements
1. A service is only eligible for payment to the Supervising Physician when the medical record of
the patient(s) identifies the following information at the time of the provision of the service:
a. The Supervising Physician;
b. The Medical Trainee and level of training;
c. The description of the insured service performed by the Medical Trainee;
d. Patient consent to the Supervision of services of a Medical Trainee; and
e. Where the service rendered is a Time-Based service, the Supervising Physician has at a
minimum, reviewed the nature and outcome of the service and the patient record(s), with the
Medical Trainee.
2. In addition to the requirements in 1 above, the Supervising Physician must have:
a. signed off on the service rendered by the Medical Trainee in the patient’s medical record; or
b. where the Supervising Physician was not immediately available to sign off on the service
rendered by the Medical Trainee, the Medical Trainee has written the date and time a
discussion occurred with the Supervising Physician regarding the provision of the service in
the patient’s medical record.
[Commentary:
Each entry into the patient’s medical record does not need to contain all of the above medical
record keeping requirements. However, it must be evident upon review of the entire medical
record that all requirements were met at the time of the provision of the Supervised service.
Supervision of the Medical Trainee by the Supervising Physician must be evident in the
medical record. This may include a physical visit to the patient and/or a chart review and
detailed discussion between the Supervising Physician, the Medical Trainee, and other
member(s) of the health team.
The service date to be used for claims is the date the Medical Trainee rendered the insured
service to the patient.]

CANCELLED SURGERY – ASSISTANT SERVICES
Payment rules:
1. If the procedure is cancelled prior to induction of anaesthesia, the service constitutes a
subsequent hospital visit.
2. When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled due to a complication prior to
commencement of surgery and the assistant has scrubbed but is not required to do anything
further, the service is payable as E006B with the actual number of time units added to 6 basic
units for this service.
[Commentary:
If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced, the amount payable is calculated
by adding the listed procedural basic units plus time units and multiplying the total by the unit
fee listed at the start of this section.]
SECOND ASSISTANT
Payment rules:
When more than one assistant was required for a surgical procedure, unless the service is listed
below, the second assistant’s service is only eligible for payment following authorization by a medical

While no occasion may arise for performing elements C, D or E, when performed in connection with
the other specific elements, they are included in the general anaesthetic service.
The general anaesthesia service includes:
a. a pre-anaesthetic evaluation, with specific elements as for assessments (see GP15);
b. the anaesthetic procedure; and
c. post-anaesthetic follow-up.
Note:
1.With the exception of the listings in the “Consultations and Visits” section, all references to an

services.
2.As defined in the General Preamble (see GP2), general anaesthesia, for the purposes of this
Schedule, includes all forms of anaesthesia except local infiltration, unless otherwise
specifically listed.
CALCULATION OF FEE PAYABLE – BASIC AND TIME UNITS
The amount payable for the anaesthesia service is calculated by adding the number of basic and time
units and multiplying the total by the anaesthesiologist unit fee.
Anaesthesiologist Unit fee .................................................. $15.49
Basic Units: The number of basic units is the number of basic units listed opposite the service in the
column headed with “Anae” except,

GENERAL PREAMBLE
ANAESTHESIOLOGISTS’ SERVICES
a. where multiple or bilateral surgical procedures are performed during the same anaesthetic,
the number of basic units listed in the column headed with “Anae” opposite the service that
describes the major procedure; or
b. where the basic units are listed as IC, or where no basic units are listed, the amount payable
is calculated by adding the appropriate time units to the basic units listed for a comparable
procedure (taking into account the region, modifying conditions, or techniques).
Time Units: Time units are calculated on the basis of time spent by the anaesthesiologist and
commence when the anaesthesiologist is first in attendance with the patient in the OR for the purpose
of initiating anaesthesia and end when the anaesthesiologist is no longer in attendance (when the
patient may safely be placed under customary post-operative supervision). Time units are calculated
for each 15 minutes or part thereof. The unit value of each 15 minute period or part thereof is:
During the first hour ................................................................ 1 unit
After the first hour up to and including the first 1.5 hours ....... 2 units
After 1.5 hours ........................................................................ 3 units
Claims submission instruction:
Submit claims for anaesthesia services rendered with a surgical procedure using the suffix “C”, with

CANCELLED SURGERY - ANAESTHESIA SERVICES
Payment rules:
1. If an anaesthesiologist examines a patient prior to surgery and the surgery is cancelled prior to
the induction of anaesthesia, the service rendered constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.
2. When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled prior to commencement of
surgery, the service constitutes E006C with the actual number of time units added to 6 basic
units for this service.
[Commentary:
If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced, the amount payable is calculated by
adding the listed procedural basic units plus time units and multiplying the total by the unit fee.]
SECOND ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
Unless otherwise specified in the Schedule, when the anaesthetic services of more than one
anaesthesiologist are necessary in the interest of the patient, the service provided by the second
anaesthesiologist constitutes E001C with the actual number of time units (based on the actual time
assisting the first anaesthesiologist) added to 6 basic units.
REPLACEMENT ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
When one anaesthesiologist starts a procedure and is replaced by another anaesthesiologist (“the
replacement anaesthesiologist”) during a surgical procedure or delivery:
a. the amount payable to the first anaesthesiologist is calculated by adding the listed
procedural basic units plus time units for the time the first anaesthesiologist is in attendance;
b. except in the case of continuous conduction anaesthesia, the service provided by the
replacement anaesthesiologist constitutes E005C based on the actual number of time units
and 6 basic units.
Note:
E005C qualifies for the premiums E400C or E401C only if the case commences after hours
(see GP94).
[Commentary:
1.Each anaesthesiologist must indicate, as part of the medical record, his/her starting and
finishing times.
2.For continuous conduction anaesthesia, the replacement anaesthesiologist submits claims
using the applicable continuous conduction anaesthesia fee code.]
OBSTETRICS – CONTINUOUS CONDUCTION ANAESTHESIA
P014C, introduction of a catheter for labour analgesia, including the first dose of medication with or
without any combined spinal-epidural injection(s), has a value of 7 basic units.
P016C time units for maintenance of obstetrical epidural anaesthesia are calculated on the basis of 1
unit for each ½ hour of time to a maximum of 12 units.
E100C time units for attendance at delivery are calculated on the basis of 4 base units and 1 unit for

Note:
For the purposes of anaesthesia services the following definitions apply:
1.Procedural Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients
respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile
stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous
ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
2.Deep Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot
be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. The
ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require
assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate.
Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
3.General Anaesthesia is a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not
arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory
function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway,
and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous
ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function
may be impaired.
ANAESTHESIA ADMINISTERED BY SAME PHYSICIAN PERFORMING A PROCEDURE
1. Except as described in paragraph 2, when a physician administers an anaesthetic, nerve block
and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in conjunction with a
diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs on the same patient,
the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication is not eligible for

On-call admission assessment
On-call admission assessment is the first hospital in-patient admission general assessment per
patient per 30-day period if:
a. the physician is a general practitioner or family physician participating in the hospital’s on-
call roster whether or not the physician is on-call the day the service is rendered;
b. the admission is non-elective; and
c. the physician is the most responsible physician with respect to subsequent in-patient care.
The amount payable for any additional on-call admission assessment rendered by the same
physician to the same patient in the same 30-day period is reduced to the amount payable for a
general re-assessment.
A933 On-call admission assessment............................................... 79.90
General/Family physician emergency department assessment
General/Family physician emergency department assessment is an assessment of a patient
that satisfies as a minimum the requirements of an intermediate assessment and is rendered
by the patient's general/family physician in an emergency department funded under an

CONSULTATIONS AND VISITS
VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this section of the Schedule only, the following Definitions apply:
Comprehensive Virtual Care Service means a Virtual Care Service rendered where an
Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship exists, and in the physicians’ professional
opinion in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice, the person's care
and support requirements can be effectively and appropriately delivered by Video or
Telephone.
Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship means:
1. Where a physician is providing a Virtual Care Service to a patient where there has been at least
one insured service with a direct physical encounter between the patient and that physician
(Family and General Practice Physician or specialist) in the preceding 24-months; or
2. Where a physician is providing a Virtual Care Service to a patient who has signed the MOH’s
Patient Enrollment and Consent to Release Personal Health Information form and is enrolled to
that physician or another physician within the same group (who is signatory/locum to a MOH
alternate funding plan agreement); or
3. Where a specialist or GP Focused Practice Physician is providing a consultation by Video set
out in Appendix J – Section 1, or has provided any such consultation in the preceding 24-
months to that patient; or
[Commentary:
Where the visit leading to the referral for consultation has occurred virtually, it would be
expected that the referring physician has an established relationship with the patient and that
the clinical issue leading to the referral has been assessed in-person within the previous 12-
months.]
[Commentary:
A consultation billed as an insured service under K083 or as an uninsured service funded
under the Ontario Virtual Care Program and rendered prior to December 1, 2022, is considered
evidence of an Existing/Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship.]
[Commentary:
Where a physician who has been paid for a consultation for the patient for the same diagnosis
makes a request for a referral for ongoing management of the patient, the service rendered
following the referral is not payable as a consultation, unless the request for referral, if the
referral is made, allows for an ongoing patient physician relationship in the context of a
consultation by Video.]
4. Where a physician provides any of the following services, or has provided any of the following
services in the preceding 24-months:
• A920 – Medical management of early pregnancy - initial service by Video or
Telephone,
• A945/C945 – Special palliative care consultation by Video,
• A680/C680 – Initial assessment - substance abuse by Video,
• A814, A817, A818 – Midwife or Aboriginal Midwife-Requested Assessments
(MRAs) by Video,
• A802 – Extended midwife or Aboriginal Midwife-requested genetic assessment by
Video,

[Commentary:
1.Follow-up Virtual Care Services provided in the 24-months subsequent to the services listed
in 3 or 4 may be claimed as Comprehensive Virtual Care Services.
2.A special palliative care consultation billed as an insured service under K092/K093 and
rendered prior to December 1, 2022, is considered evidence of an Existing/Ongoing Patient-
Physician Relationship.]
GP Focused Practice Physician means, for the purpose of eligibility to provide a focused
practice consultation by Video (A010, A011, A906, A913, A914), a physician who has been
designated by the bi-lateral MOH-OMA GP Focused Practice Review Committee or a physician
who is eligible for the focused practice psychotherapy premium.
Limited Virtual Care Service means a Virtual Care Service rendered where an Existing/
Ongoing Patient-Physician Relationship does not exist, and in the physicians’ professional
opinion in accordance with accepted professional standards and practice, the person's care
and support requirements can be effectively and appropriately delivered by Video or
Telephone.
Verified-Virtual Visit Solution means virtual service delivery platforms listed on Ontario
Health’s public list of verified solutions.
Virtual Care Service means a service provided using information technologies to render
eligible services to patients remotely.
Eligible Virtual Care Service modalities are:
Telephone means synchronous audio-only communication (no visualization); and
Video means 2-way synchronous video-conference (audio and Video visualization) using a
Verified-Virtual Visit Solution;
Terms and Conditions for Virtual Care Services
1. Other than a direct physical encounter, all other requirements and conditions for the appropriate
service as described in the Schedule must be met.
2. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment where it is not medically appropriate to
provide the specific service without a direct physical encounter.
a. If during the course of a Virtual Care Service it becomes apparent that the service cannot be
appropriately completed without a direct physical encounter, the Virtual Care Service is not
eligible for payment (only the service with a direct physical encounter is eligible for
payment).

VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
b. Where a patient requests a virtual visit (is not willing to present in-person, despite the
physician’s advice and availability), physicians may submit a claim for the appropriate fee
code for the service that was rendered virtually.
3. Video services are only eligible for payment when performed using a Verified Virtual Visit
Solution.
[Commentary:
Ontario Health’s public list of verified solutions is available at: https://www.ontariohealth.ca/our-
work/digital-standards/virtual-visits-verification-standard/vendor-list.]
4. All other insured services that are rendered by Video or Telephone to insured persons and that
are not Comprehensive Virtual Care Services, Limited Virtual Care Services, or specifically
listed as insured services or are a component of an insured service are not eligible for payment.
5. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless the delivery modality is documented on
the patient's medical record.
6. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless initiated by the patient or the patient’s
representative, or the service represents a medically necessary follow-up visit to a preceding
visit initiated by the patient or the patient’s representative.
[Commentary:
As per GP15, following an insured service, discussion with, and providing advice and
information, including prescribing therapy to the patient or the patient’s representative, whether
by Telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service is a specific element of the
preceding service and should not be separately claimed. This includes reporting results of
related procedures and/or assessments (when professionally appropriate to report without
additional patient assessment) and monitoring the patient’s condition remotely until the next
medically necessary assessment.
For clarity, administrative staff may co-ordinate appointments and organize care in a manner
analogous to in-person encounters without violating this condition. Similarly, medically
necessary follow-up services may be organized by the provider (or by their staff) without
violating the condition. However, a physician-initiated call to “check-in” on a patient would not
be eligible for payment, nor would any telephone calls or Video encounters conducted for
administrative purposes (such as to inform patients of clinic closures or the availability of
remote services).
Furthermore, services are not eligible for payment when initiated by the physician (or the
physician’s staff) without a clear and medically necessary reason for doing so. For example,
the communication of normal lab work, unless medically necessary (in so far as the clinical
management of the patient is altered) should not be billed.
Physician-initiated communication to provide advice or guidance regarding a previously
rendered service is also not separately eligible/ billable. A common example of this would occur
when a patient is provided with a prescription along with instruction to fill it only upon receipt of
a positive test result. The call to inform the patient of the test result is not eligible for payment
as it would be considered a Specific Element of the initial (refer to: item F, GP15, Schedule of
Benefits).
Amd 12 Draft 1 A64 February 14 , 2 025 (e ffective M arch 3, 2025)

--- PAGE 193 ---
CONSULTATIONS AND VISITS
VIRTUAL CARE SERVICES
As a general rule, the provider should consider whether the remote encounter would have
occurred in their “in-person” practice. In circumstances where an in-person encounter would
not have taken place, it is unlikely that a claim for a virtual service could be supported.
Consultations, which arise from requests from other providers, would not violate the condition
in so far as the patient would have assented to the referral as part of their discussion with the
referring provider.]
7. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment unless personally performed by the physician
or rendered in accordance with the payment rules regarding supervision of a Medical Trainee.
8. Virtual Care Services are not eligible for payment for services provided to hospital inpatients or
patients in a Long-Term Care institution unless all of the following requirements have been met:
• The physician providing the service is not the patient's MRP.
• The hospital/Long-Term Care institution does not have a physician on staff and
present in the community with the expertise to render the necessary service, as
documented by the referring physician in the patient’s medical record.
• An assessment with a direct physical encounter by the referring physician must
have been completed within 30 days preceding a virtual in-patient specialist
consultation to confirm the need for a consultation.
9. Services involving a direct physical encounter must be made available by the physician
providing Comprehensive Virtual Care Services, or by the physician’s group, within a clinically
appropriate time-frame, if it becomes apparent during a Virtual Care Service that a service
involving a direct physical encounter is medically necessary, or if at the time of scheduling the
service the patient expresses preference for a service involving a direct physical encounter.
[Commentary:
For the purpose of this provision, with respect to specialist and GP Focused Practice
Physicians, a group is defined as: those physicians in the same hospital specialty call rotation,
or who are co-located in shared clinical physical space, and have shared access to the
patient’s medical record. For family and general practice physicians, a group is defined as:
Patient Enrollment Model physicians who are signatory or contracted to the same specific
group contract (i.e., as identified by the same group billing number), or those physicians who
are co-located in a shared clinical physical space and have shared access to the patient’s
medical record].
10.If during the course of a Virtual Care Service the modality changes (for example, a Telephone
service transitions into a Video service), only the service performed by the modality that
represents the greater part (more than 50%) of the time spent providing the Virtual Care Service
is payable. For time-based services, the combined time of both modalities will be used to
calculate the number of time units eligible for payment.
11. For time-based services, only time spent in direct communication with the patient or the
patient’s representative in the provision of the insured service will be used to calculate the
number of time units eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
Both the patient and physician must be located in Ontario for the services to be insured and
payable under OHIP (see section 37.1 of Regulation 552 under the HIA).]

PREAMBLE
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
Nuclear Medicine procedures are divided into a professional component listed in the columns headed
with a "P", and a technical component listed in the column headed with an "H". The technical
component of the procedure subject to the conditions stated under "Diagnostic Services Rendered at
a Hospital" on page GP11, is eligible for payment only if the service is:
a. rendered at a hospital; or
b. rendered at an off-site premise operated by a hospital corporation that has received
approval under section 4 of the Public Hospitals Act.
In addition to the common elements, the components of Nuclear Medicine procedures include the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable.
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is(are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
Note:
1.Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
2.If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B
and C, these may be delegated to another physician.
3.Where the only component provided is interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure,
the specific elements A and C listed for the professional component are included in the
specific elements of the technical component.
For Technical Component H
A. Preparing the patient for the procedure.
B. Performing the diagnostic procedure(s).
C. Making arrangements for any appropriate follow-up care.
D. Providing records of the results of the procedure to the interpreting physician.
E. Discussion with, and providing information and advice to, the patient or patient’s representative,
whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the service.
F. Preparing and transmitting a written, signed and dated interpretive report of the procedure to the
referring provider.
G. Providing premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for all specific elements of the technical
and professional components except for the premises for any aspect(s) of A and D of the
professional component that is(are) not performed at the place in which the procedure is
performed.

OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. Professional and technical components are claimed separately. Claims for the technical
component H are submitted using listed fee code with suffix B. Claims for professional
component are submitted using listed fee code with suffix C. (e.g. J802C)
2. For services rendered outside a hospital setting the only fees billable under the Health
Insurance Act are listed under P (use suffix C). Costs for the technical component of these
services are only billable under the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.
3. With the exception of J818, J835, J821, J834, J880 or when SPECT is claimed, if quantification
or data manipulation is carried out in addition to visual inspection of imaging studies, add 30%
to the appropriate professional benefit. For claim purposes, use prefix “Y”. Such activity must
add significant diagnostic information not available by inspection alone and does not include
simple image enhancement techniques such as smoothing, background subtraction, etc.
Recording of images on videotape for replay and production of images on the video display of a
computer do not in themselves justify the additional benefit. The claims for cardiac wall motion
studies and calculation of ventricular ejection fraction (J811 and J813) already include an
allowance for data manipulation as a general rule and no additional benefit may be claimed.
The additional computer benefit may be claimed only when additional cardiac quantifications
are performed i.e. stroke volume ratio and volume response curves and/or phase analysis.
4. If examination of Brain, Lung, Liver or Spleen is limited to one view, the benefit (H and P) is to
be reduced by 50%.
5. Repeat studies on the same day may be claimed only after exercise or drug intervention.
6. When tomographic examination (SPECT) is billed, the 30% add-on referred to in paragraph 3
may not be claimed.
7. Costs for the technical component of services rendered in an ICHSC are listed in the Schedule
of Facility Costs.
8. The technical and professional fee components for myocardial perfusion imaging /
echocardiogram/exercise stress test/stress echocardiogram are not eligible for payment in the
routine preoperative preparation or screening of a patient for surgery where the patient will
undergo a low risk procedure or has a low risk of perioperative cardiac complications, unless
there is a clinical indication requiring myocardial perfusion imaging/exercise stress test/cardiac
stress echo studies other than solely for preoperative preparation of the patient.
[Commentary:
1.Studies have indicated that for non cardiac surgery, there may be no clinical benefit and
there may be harm in performing functional cardiac testing in patients with low operative risk
and little or limited benefit in moderate risk patients. BMJ 2010, Jan 28; 340.
2.One example of a generally accepted guideline is the American College of Cardiology
(ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines that states:
a.Non invasive testing could be considered in patients with 1 to 2 risk factors and poor
functional capacity (less than 4 mets) who require intermediate risk surgery if it will
change management (class IIb)
b.Non invasive testing has not been show to be useful in patients with no clinical risk factors
undergoing intermediate risk non cardiac surgery (class III).
c.Non invasive testing has not been shown to useful in patients undergoing low risk non
cardiac surgery (class III)]

Note:
1.PET scanning is an insured service only for the investigation of the indications listed below.
2.PET scanning for all oncologic or suspected oncologic indications must be performed using a
combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanner (PET/CT) in order
to localize anatomically any areas of abnormality on the PET image.
3.Interpretation of a CT scan performed to identify the anatomical location of a PET scan
abnormality or for attenuation correction is not eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
1.It is expected that the physician requesting a PET scan is making clinical decisions related to
the treatment of the patient or is basing their request on the recommendation of the treating
physician.
2.A PET scan may be available for indications other than those listed below through other PET
Scans Ontario programs. PET Scans Ontario is coordinated by Ontario Health. The contact
