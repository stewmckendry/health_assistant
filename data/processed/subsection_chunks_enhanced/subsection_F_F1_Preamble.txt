MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)March 4, 2024 (effective April 1, 2024)
PREAMBLE
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
In addition to the common elements, the professional component of MRI procedures includes the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component P
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate, and quality control of all elements of the technical component
of the procedure.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable (e.g. injections which are an integral part of the study).
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is(are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B and C,
these may be delegated to another physician, who must personally perform the service.
Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.
OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
MRI studies of the lumbar spine should not be routinely ordered or rendered for low back pain without
suspected or known pathology.
[Commentary:
Examples of suspected or known pathology include infection, tumour, osteoporosis, ankylosing
spondylitis, fracture, inflammatory process, radicular syndrome, and cauda equina syndrome.]

X481 MRI guidance of biopsy or lesion ablation, internal organ...... 285.00
Note:
X480 and X481 are only eligible for payment when a lesion can only be visualized by MRI or
the use of another image guidance modality is not technically feasible.
[Commentary:
1. X487 and/or X499 may be eligible for payment in addition to X480 or X481.
2. Biopsy fee codes specific to the breast or internal organ may be eligible for payment in
addition to X480 or X481.]

2. X441/X445 thorax MRI is not eligible for payment same day, same physician as X446/X447.
Note:
Breast MRI is not an insured service for routine screening of an average risk individual.

X461 - multislice sequence ............................................................ 73.35
X465 - repeat (another plane, different pulse sequence - to a
maximum of 3 repeats)....................................................... 36.70
Extremity or joint(s)
X471 - multislice sequence, one extremity and/or one joint........... 62.80
X475 - repeat (another plane, different pulse sequence - to a
maximum of 3 repeats)....................................................... 31.45
X488 - multislice sequence, two or more extremities, and/or two or
more joints same extremity ................................................ 108.80
X489 - repeat (another plane, different pulse sequence - to a
maximum of 3 repeats)....................................................... 54.35
Note:
1. X488 and X489 require imaging of two extremities or two or more joints in the same extremity
during the same examination at one sitting.
2. X488 and X489 requires separate surface coil, separate imaging sequence, separate filming
and separate post-processing for each joint examined.
3. For the purposes of X471, X475, X488 and X489, the following are considered eligible joints:
shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee and ankle.
[Commentary:
When weight-bearing x-rays demonstrate osteoarthritis and symptoms are suggestive of
osteoarthritis, knee MRI scans are not recommended by the Canadian Orthopaedic
Association, the Canadian Arthroplasty Society and the Arthroscopy Association of Canada as
this investigation rarely adds useful information to guide diagnosis or treatment. https://
