SURGICAL SERVICES WHICH ARE NOT LISTED AS A "Z" CODE
In addition to the above, the fee for this service includes the following:
1. Pre-operative Care and Visits
Pre-operative hospital visits which take place 1 or 2 days prior to surgery.
2. Post-operative Care and Visits
Post-operative care and visits associated with the procedure for up to two weeks post-

PREAMBLE
OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
FOR DEFINITION OF THE ROLE OF THE SURGICAL ASSISTANT - SEE GENERAL
PREAMBLE GP85.
FOR DEFINITION OF THE ROLES OF THE ANAESTHESIOLOGIST - SEE GENERAL
PREAMBLE GP92.
With the exception of the listings in the “Consultations and Visits” section, all references to surgeon in
this Schedule are references to any physician performing the surgical procedure.
1. If the surgeon is required to perform a service(s) not usually associated with the original surgical
procedure, he/she may claim for these on a fee-for-service basis.
If special visits to hospital are required at any time post-operatively, the surgeon may claim the
minimum special visit premiums even if the basic hospital visit fees may not be claimed (under
these circumstances the hospital visits should be claimed on an N/C ($00.00) basis).
The surgical benefit as noted above does not include the major pre-operative visit - i.e. the
consultation or assessment fee which may be claimed when the decision to operate is made
and the operation is scheduled, regardless of the time interval between the major pre-operative
visit and surgery.
The hospital or day care admission assessment (consultation, repeat consultation, general or
specific assessment or re-assessment, partial assessment) may not be claimed by the surgeon
unless it happens to be the major pre-operative visit as defined above.
Routine subsequent hospital visits may be claimed for visits rendered more than two days prior
to surgery. Other visits (excluding admission assessments) prior to admission may be claimed
for in addition to the surgical fee.
Because the number of hospital visits is limited to three per week after the fifth week of
hospitalization and six per month after the thirteenth week of hospitalization, the starting point
for calculating the number of hospital visits is based on the date of admission if the operating
surgeon has admitted the patient or the date of referral if the patient has been referred to the
operating surgeon while in hospital.
The listed benefit for a procedure normally includes repair of any iatrogenic complications
occurring during the course of the surgery performed by the same surgeon. Other major
interventions should be handled on an individual basis. The surgical benefit includes the
generally accepted surgical components of the procedure.
2. When a physician makes a special visit to perform a non-elective surgical procedure, he/she
may claim the following benefits for procedures commencing:
a. 07:00h -17:00h - Monday to Friday
A consultation (if the case is referred) or the appropriate assessment, the appropriate
special visit premium plus the procedural benefit.
b. 17:00h - 07:00h - Any night or on Saturdays/Sundays or Holidays
A consultation or assessment, the appropriate special visit premium, the procedural benefit
plus the surgical premium E409 or E410.
(see General Preamble GP65 to GP78 and GP104).

3. When more than one procedure is carried out by a surgeon under the same anaesthesia or
within 14 days during the same hospitalization for the same condition, the full benefit applies to
the major procedure and 85% of the listed benefit(s) applies to the other procedure(s)
performed unless otherwise stated in the Preamble(s) or Schedule. The above statement
applies to staged or bilateral procedures but does not apply when a normal appendix or simple
ovarian or para-ovarian cyst is removed incidentally during an operation, for which no claim
should be made.
4. When a subsequent operation becomes necessary for the same condition because of a
complication or for a new condition, the full benefit should apply for each procedure.
5. When a subsequent non-elective procedure is done for a new condition by the same surgeon,
the full benefit will apply to each procedure. When a subsequent elective procedure is done for
a different condition within 14 days during the same hospitalization by the same surgeon, the
benefit for the lesser procedure shall be reduced by 15%.
6. When different operative procedures are done by two different surgeons under the same
anaesthesia for different conditions, the benefit will be 100% of the listed benefit for each
condition. Under these circumstances, the basic assistant’s benefit should not be claimed by
either operating surgeon; however time units may be claimed.
7. As a general rule, when elective bilateral procedures are performed by two surgeons at the
same time, one surgeon should claim for the surgical procedures and the other surgeon should
claim the assistant’s benefit.
8. Where two surgeons are working together in surgery in which neither a team fee nor other
method of billing is set out in the benefit schedule, the surgeon should identify him/herself as
the operating surgeon and claim accordingly; the surgeon who is assisting the operating
surgeon should identify him/herself as such and claim the assistant’s benefit.
Where the second or assistant surgeon is brought into the case on a consultation basis, he/she
may, when indicated, claim a consultation as well but should be prepared to justify it on an IC
basis.
Except where otherwise provided in this Schedule, if the nature or complexity of a procedure
requires more than one operating surgeon, each providing a separate service in his/her own
specialized field, e.g. one surgeon carries out the ablative part and another surgeon the
reconstructive part of the procedure, then each surgeon should claim the listed benefit for his/
her services. This statement applies when the additional procedure(s) are not the usual
components of the main procedure. If one surgeon, in addition to performing a specialized
portion of a procedure, acts as an assistant during the remainder of the procedure, he/she may
also claim time units for assisting.
When surgical procedures are rendered to trauma patients who have an Injury Severity Score
(ISS) of greater than 15 for individuals age 16 or more, or an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of
greater than 12 for individuals less than age 16, and it is required that two surgeons perform
components of the same procedure, the full surgical fee for that procedure is payable to each
surgeon.
[Commentary:
The full surgical fee is payable to each surgeon for surgical procedures rendered either on the
day of the trauma or within 24 hours of the trauma.]

9. Unless otherwise stated, the listed benefits are for unilateral procedures only.
10.When a procedure is performed, a procedural benefit, if listed, should be claimed. Substitution
of consultation and/or visit benefits for procedural benefits (except as in paragraph 11), is not in
keeping with the intent of the benefit schedule.
11. When a surgical benefit (non-IOP, Complete Care, Fracture or Dislocation) is less than the
surgical consultation benefit, and the case is referred, a physician may claim a surgical
consultation benefit instead of the surgical benefit. However, to avoid the consultation being
counted as such under the Ministry of Health limitation rules on the number of consultations
allowed per year, the physician should claim the consultation fee under the surgical procedure
nomenclature or code. Since the consultation is replacing a procedural benefit which includes
the pre- and post-operative and surgical care, no additional claims beyond the consultation
should be made.
12.If a physician performs a minor surgical procedure and during the same visit assesses and
treats the patient for another completely unrelated and significant problem involving another
body system, the physician should claim for the procedure as well as the appropriate
assessment.
13.Where a procedure is listed with a “Z” code, the procedure is an “Independent Operative
Procedure (IOP)”. If the major pre-operative visit is rendered in the previous 12-month period
prior to the IOP service by the same physician, only the following assessment services are
eligible for payment on the same day prior to the IOP service:
a. a minor assessment if rendered by a General and Family Physician; or
b. a partial assessment if rendered by a specialist.
When the major preoperative assessment is rendered on the same day as the IOP, no other
consultation or assessment is eligible for payment if rendered prior to the IOP service by the
same physician on the same day.
When multiple or bilateral IOP are performed at the same time by the same physician, the
listed procedural benefits should be claimed in full but the pre- and post-operative benefits
should be claimed as if only one procedure had been performed.
When an IOP service is rendered on the same day as a non-IOP service by the same
physician, the terms and conditions for payment as described in the ‘Surgical Services which
are not listed as a "Z" code’ section of this Schedule are also applicable to the IOP service(s).
14.When procedures are specifically listed under Surgical Procedures, surgeons should use these
listings rather than applying one of the plastic surgery listed fees under Skin and Subcutaneous
Tissue in the Integumentary System Surgical Procedures section of this Schedule.
15.For excision of tumours not specifically listed in this Schedule, claims should be made on an IC
basis (code R993). Independent Consideration also will be given (under code R990) to claims
for other unusual but generally accepted surgical procedures which are not listed specifically in
the Schedule (excluding non-major variations of listed procedures). In submitting claims,
physicians should relate the service rendered to comparable listed procedures in terms of
scope and difficulty (see General Preamble GP12).

16.Cosmetic or esthetic surgery: means a service to enhance appearance without being
medically necessary. These services are not insured benefits (see Appendix D.)
17.Reconstructive surgery: is surgery to improve appearance and/or function to any area altered
by disease, trauma or congenital deformity. Although surgery solely to restore appearance may
be included in this definition under certain limited conditions, emotional, psychological or
psychiatric grounds normally are not considered sufficient additional reason for coverage of
such surgery. Appendix D of this Schedule describes the conditions under which surgery for
alteration of appearance only may be a benefit. Physicians should submit requests to their
regional OHIP Office for authorization of any proposed surgery which may fall outside of
Ministry of Health coverage. (See Appendix D.)
18.Additional claims for biopsies performed when a surgeon is operating in the abdominal or
thoracic cavity will be given Independent Consideration.
19.When a listed procedure is performed and no anaesthetic is required, the procedure should be
claimed under the “local anaesthetic” listing.
20.Except as described in the paragraph below, when a physician administers an anaesthetic,
nerve block and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in
conjunction with a diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs
on the same patient, the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication
is not eligible for payment.
A major or minor peripheral nerve block, major plexus block, neuraxial injection (with or without
catheter) or intrapleural block (with or without catheter) for post-operative pain control (with a
duration of action more than 4 hours) is eligible for payment as G224 when rendered in
conjunction with a procedure which the physician performs on the same patient.
[Commentary:
For additional information, refer to the Nerve Blocks - Acute Pain Management, Nerve Blocks -
Interventional Pain Injections or Nerve Blocks - Peripheral/Other sections of the Schedule.]
21.If claims are being submitted in coded form, the surgeon should add the suffix A to the listed
procedural code, the surgical assistant should add the suffix B to the listed procedural code and
the anaesthetist should add the suffix C to the listed procedural code.
22.When Z222/Z223 is claimed for a patient for whom the physician submits a claim for rendering
another insured service on the same day, the amount payable for Z222/Z223 is reduced to nil.
23.When a surgical procedure is attempted laparoscopically in the digestive system or the female
genital system, but requires conversion to a laparotomy, unless otherwise specified, the
diagnostic laparoscopic fee E860 is payable in addition to the procedural fee.

24.Morbidly obese patients
E676 is eligible for payment once per patient per physician in addition to the amount eligible for
payment for the major surgical procedure(s) where a morbidly obese patient undergoes major
surgery to the neck, thorax, peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum, pelvis, or hip and:
a. the patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 40 for major surgery on the thorax,
peritoneal cavity, retroperitoneum, pelvis, or hip, or a BMI greater than 45 for major surgery
on the neck;
b. the surgery is rendered under general anaesthesia using either an open technique for the
neck, thorax, or hip, or an open or laparoscopic technique for the peritoneal cavity, pelvis,
retroperitoneum; and
c. the principal surgical technique is neither aspiration, core or fine needle biopsy, dilation,
endoscopy, mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, cautery, ablation nor catheterization.
E676A Morbidly obese patient, surgeon, to procedural fee(s)...... add 25%
E676B Morbidly obese patient, surgical assistant, to major procedure
add 6 units
Note:
E676A/B is only payable with the following procedures: D043, D046, D047, D052, E090, E499,

Medical record requirements:
E676 is only eligible for payment when the BMI is recorded in the patient's permanent medical
record.
[Commentary:
E676 is not eligible for payment if the surgery is rendered under local anaesthesia.]
25.Lysis of extensive intra-abdominal adhesions and/or scarring e.g. post radiation
E673 is payable to the surgeon in addition to the fee for the major intra-abdominal procedure
only when lysis requires at least 60 minutes beyond the average duration of the major
procedure. E673 less than 60 minutes in duration or rendered in conjunction with E718 is an
insured service payable at nil.
# E673 Lysis of extensive intra-abdominal adhesions .................. add 62.05
26.Payment for all surgical procedures includes payment for any intraoperative monitoring of the
patient, if rendered.
27.Cancelled surgery – surgical services
a. If the procedure is cancelled prior to induction of anaesthesia, the service constitutes a
subsequent hospital visit.
b. When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled due to a complication prior to
commencement of surgery and the surgeon has scrubbed but is not required to do anything
further, the service constitutes E006A and the amount payable is calculated by adding the
time units to 6 basic units and multiplying by the surgical assistant’s unit fee.
c. If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced but prior to its completion, the
service is eligible for payment under independent consideration (R990).
[Commentary:
Submit claim for R990 by adding the time units to the listed procedural basic units and
multiplying by the surgical assistant’s unit fee and attach a copy of the operative report for
review by a medical consultant.]
Note:
For the purpose of cancelled surgery, time units for the surgeon are calculated in the same way
as time units for the surgical assistant (see General Preamble GP85).
28.Bariatric surgery
S120 (gastric bypass or partition), S189 (intestinal bypass) and S114 (sleeve gastrectomy) are
insured services only when all of the following four criteria are satisfied:
1.Presence of morbid obesity that has persisted for at least the preceding 2 years, defined as:
a.Body mass index (BMI) exceeding 40; or
b.BMI greater than 35 in conjunction with any of the following severe co-morbidities:
i. Coronary heart disease;
ii. Diabetes mellitus;
iii. Clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea (i.e. patient meets the criteria for
treatment of obstructive sleep apnea); or

bone growth);
3.The patient has attempted weight loss in the past without successful long-term weight
reduction; and
4.The patient must be recommended for the surgery by a multidisciplinary team at a Regional
Assessment and Treatment Centre in Ontario.

number only.
If the recipient is from out-of-province, submit claims using the recipient’s provincial health
insurance number.
Transplant donor: Submit claims using the transplant donor’s Ontario health insurance
number.
For a donor with a health insurance number from another province or for a donor from another
country, submit claims using the Ontario recipient’s health insurance number.
In circumstances where the donor is an Ontario resident but the health insurance number
cannot be obtained despite reasonable efforts to do so, use the recipient’s Ontario health
insurance number.
