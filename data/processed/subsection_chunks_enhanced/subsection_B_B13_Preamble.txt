POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET)
PREAMBLE
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS
In addition to the common elements, the professional component of PET procedures includes the
following specific elements.
For Professional Component P
A. Providing clinical supervision, including approving, modifying and/or intervening in the performance
of the procedure where appropriate, and quality control of all elements of the technical component
of the procedure.
B. Performance of any clinical procedure associated with the diagnostic procedure which is not
separately billable (e.g. injections which are an integral part of the study).
C. Where appropriate, post-procedure monitoring, including intervening except where this constitutes
a separately billable service.
D. Interpreting the results of the diagnostic procedure.
E. Providing premises for any aspect(s) of A and D that is(are) performed at a place other than the
place in which the procedure is performed.
If the physician claiming the fee for the service is personally unable to perform elements A, B and C,
these may be delegated to another physician, who must personally perform the service.
Element D must be personally performed by the physician who claims for the service.

Note:
1.PET scanning is an insured service only for the investigation of the indications listed below.
2.PET scanning for all oncologic or suspected oncologic indications must be performed using a
combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanner (PET/CT) in order
to localize anatomically any areas of abnormality on the PET image.
3.Interpretation of a CT scan performed to identify the anatomical location of a PET scan
abnormality or for attenuation correction is not eligible for payment.
[Commentary:
1.It is expected that the physician requesting a PET scan is making clinical decisions related to
the treatment of the patient or is basing their request on the recommendation of the treating
physician.
2.A PET scan may be available for indications other than those listed below through other PET
Scans Ontario programs. PET Scans Ontario is coordinated by Ontario Health. The contact
number is 1-877-473-8411. A full list of all funded indications in Ontario is available at
CCOHealth.ca/PET.]
Solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN)
Solitary pulmonary nodule for which a diagnosis could not be established by a needle biopsy
due to:
a. unsuccessful attempted needle biopsy;
b. the SPN is inaccessible to needle biopsy; or
c. the existence of a contra-indication to the use of needle biopsy.
J700 Solitary pulmonary nodule ..................................................... 255.20
Thyroid cancer
Thyroid cancer for which standard imaging studies, including I-131 scan and/or neck
ultrasound, are negative or equivocal, and recurrent or persistent disease is suspected on the
basis of an elevated and/or rising thyroglobulin level(s).
J701 Thyroid cancer........................................................................ 255.20
Germ cell tumour
Germ cell tumour for which recurrent or persistent disease is suspected on the basis of:
a. elevated tumour marker(s) (beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and/or alpha
fetoprotein) in the presence of negative or equivocal standard imaging studies; or
b. the presence of a residual mass after primary treatment for seminoma when curative
surgical resection is being considered.

POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET)
P
Colorectal cancer
Colorectal cancer for which standard imaging studies are negative or equivocal and recurrent
disease after surgical resection is suspected on the basis of an elevated and/or rising
carcinoembryronic antigen (CEA) level(s).
J703 Colorectal cancer.................................................................... 255.20
Lymphoma
For the evaluation of a residual mass(es) following chemotherapy in a patient with Hodgkin’s or
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma when further potentially curative therapy (such as radiation or stem
cell transplantation) is being considered.
J704 Lymphoma for the evaluation of a residual mass(es) ............. 255.20
For the assessment of response in early stage Hodgkin’s lymphoma following 2 or 3 cycles of
chemotherapy when chemotherapy is being considered as the definitive single modality
therapy.
J705 Lymphoma for the assessment of response to treatment....... 255.20
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):
a. For which curative surgical resection is being considered based on negative standard
imaging tests; or
b. For clinical stage III NSCLC which is being considered for potentially curative combined
modality therapy with radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
J706 Non-small cell lung cancer...................................................... 255.20
Limited disease small cell lung cancer
Limited disease small cell lung cancer for evaluation and staging where combined modality
therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is being considered.
J709 Limited disease small cell lung cancer ................................... 255.20
Esophageal carcinoma
a. Baseline staging assessment of those patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer being
considered for curative therapy.
b. Repeat PET/CT scan on completion of pre-operative/neoadjuvant therapy, prior to surgery.
J710 Esophageal carcinoma ........................................................... 255.20
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma – evaluation of neck nodes
J711 Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma – evaluation of neck
nodes.................................................................................. 255.20
Note:
J711 is only insured when the primary disease site is unknown after radiologic and
clinical investigation.
Liver metastasis from colorectal cancer
Prior to surgery for resection of metastatic lesions from colorectal cancer only when:
a. The surgical procedure on the liver is high risk; or
b. The patient is considered at high risk for surgery.

Cardiac PET using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
Cardiac PET using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for myocardial viability assessment in a patient
that:
a. has moderate to severe ischemic left ventricular dysfunction (left ejection less than or equal
to 40%) despite maximal medical therapy; and
b. is a suitable candidate for a cardiac revascularization procedure or cardiac transplantation.
J707 - cardiac PET........................................................................ 237.50
J708 - cardiac PET with quantitative analysis, to J707... add 0%
Note:
PET is an insured service for the clarification of myocardial viability when:
a.a previous myocardial imaging assessment has been rendered, using another modality
(e.g. SPECT using thallium, MIBI or dobutamine stress echocardiography) and the result
of the previous imaging assessment was equivocal or demonstrated insufficient viable
myocardium; or
b.a patient with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% and known multi-vessel
coronary disease determined by coronary angiography urgently needs an assessment of
myocardial viability.
[Commentary:
Examples of other modalities for assessing viability include SPECT imaging using myocardial
perfusion agents such as thallium, MIBI or tetrofosmin, or dobutamine stress
echocardiography.]
Payment rules:
Only one of J700, J701, J702, J703, J704, J705, J706, J707, J709 or J710 is eligible for
