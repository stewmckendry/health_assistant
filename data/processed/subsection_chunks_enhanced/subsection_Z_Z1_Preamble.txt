SPINAL SURGICAL PROCEDURES
Spinal Surgical ProceduresMarch 4, 2024 (effective April 1, 2024)
PREAMBLE
[Commentary:
The structure of this section uses “N” prefix codes to describe the basic elements of spine
surgery: decompression and arthrodesis (fusion), both anterior and posterior. Specific “E”
prefix codes can be added where indicated to determine the amount payable for a particular
operation. In accordance with the surgical preamble, the full fee applies to the major procedure
and additional “N” prefix procedures are payable in addition to the major procedure at 85% of
the fee unless otherwise stated.]
OTHER TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
1. The preamble to the Musculoskeletal System Surgical Procedures section also applies to this
section as applicable (e.g. fractures).
2. Fusion of one disc level (one motion segment) includes two levels of instrumentation.
3. Obtaining bone for grafting is included as a component of all fusion procedures and is not
eligible for payment when performed with any fusion procedure.
4. Thoracotomy performed in conjunction with spinal procedures by a surgeon not performing the
spinal surgery constitutes M137 (P13).
5. Laparotomy performed in conjunction with spinal procedures by a surgeon not performing the
spinal surgery constitutes S312 (S34).
6. Three-dimensional (3D) computer-assisted stereotactic navigation (E378) must include the pre-
operative or intra-operative generation of axial, sagittal and coronal reformatted images that are
processed and virtually represented in 3D by a surgical navigational system. In addition, the
surgical navigational system must be used to reflect the position of an image-guided (tracked)
surgical tool(s) relative to the patient's anatomy. This may be performed by either frame or
frameless technique and applies to any spinal level.
7. Two-dimensional (2D) computer-assisted stereotactic navigation (E379) must include the intra-
operative generation of antero-posterior, lateral or multiple oblique 2D views that are processed
and virtually represented in 2D by a surgical navigational system. In addition, the surgical
navigational system must be used to reflect the position of an image-guided (tracked) surgical
tool(s) relative to the patient's anatomy. This may be performed by either frame or frameless
technique and applies to any spinal level.
Note:
The use of an intra-operative imaging tool such as a portable x-ray, fluoroscope (2D or 3D), CT,
MRI or ultrasound for "live" localization without a surgical navigational system as defined
above does not constitute E378 or E379 and is not eligible for payment.
8. Acute spinal cord injury premium (E383) is only eligible for payment when rendered to patients
who are described under ASIA impairment scale ratings A to C and have acute conditions
which have been present for 6 weeks or less.
ASIA IMPAIRMENT SCALE
A. Complete - No motor or sensory function is preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5.
B. Incomplete - Sensory but not motor function is preserved below the neurological level and
extends though the sacral segments S4-S5.

SPINAL SURGICAL PROCEDURES
PREAMBLE
C. Incomplete - Motor function is preserved below the neurological level, and the majority of key
muscles below the neurological level have a muscle grade less than 3.
9. Use of the operating microscope, both intra and extradural, when required, is included as a
component of all spinal fee schedule codes and is not eligible for payment when rendered with
any procedure in this section.
