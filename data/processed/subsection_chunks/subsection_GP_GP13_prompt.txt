GENERAL PREAMBLE
CONSTITUENT AND COMMON ELEMENTS OF INSURED SERVICES
[Commentary:
This Schedule identifies the constituent elements that comprise insured services. Common
elements apply to all insured services and specific elements apply to specific groups of
services where identified either in the General Preamble or in the preamble to a specific
system and/or specialty sections of the Schedule. There may be additional specific
requirements (“required elements of service”, “payment rules”, “claims submission instructions”
or “notes”) for some individual services, and these are noted with the description of any such
service within the Schedule. In order to determine the correct claim to use for a service
rendered, the necessary information is found by reviewing the common elements, specific
elements, and service specific information.
No charges may be made (except to OHIP) for an insured service rendered to an insured
person or for any of the constituent elements of such insured services. This is prohibited by the
Act and/or the Commitment to the Future of Medicare Act, 2004.
Most services include as a constituent element of the service the provision of the premises,
equipment, supplies, and personnel used in the performance of the common and specific
elements of the service. This is not, however, the case for services denoted by codes marked
with the prefix “#”, and for services that are divided into professional and technical components
where only the professional component is an insured service under the Act.
For those codes denoted with the prefix “#” and performed in a hospital, the premises,
equipment, supplies, and personnel used to perform all elements of the service are funded by
the hospital global budget.
For those services denoted with the prefix “#” and provided in an Integrated Community Health
Services Centre (ICHSC), the premises, equipment, supplies, and personnel are funded under
the facility costs set out in the Integrated Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.
Patients cannot be charged for the premises, equipment, supplies and personnel for services
denoted with the prefix “#” rendered outside of a hospital or ICHSC if the premises, equipment,
supplies and personnel support, assist or provide a necessary adjunct to an insured service
denoted with the prefix “#” as charging a patient would be contrary to the Integrated
Community Health Services Centres Act, 2023.]
COMMON ELEMENTS OF INSURED SERVICES
All insured services include the skill, time, and responsibility involved in performing, including when
delegated to a non-physician in accordance with the Delegated Procedures Section (GP62) of the
General Preamble, supervising the performance of the constituent elements of the service.
Unless otherwise specifically listed in the Schedule, the following elements are common to all insured
services.
A. Being available to provide follow-up insured services to the patient and arranging for coverage
when not available.
B. Making arrangements for appointment(s) for the insured service.
C. Travelling to and from the place(s) where any element(s) of the service is (are) performed.
[Commentary:
Travelling to visit an insured person outside of the usual geographical area of practice of the
person making the visit is an uninsured service – see Regulation 552 section 24(1) paragraph
1 under the Act.]
