Payment Rules
A. GENERAL
1. A service rendered by a Medical Trainee is only eligible for payment to the Supervising
Physician where Supervision is provided as defined above and subject to the specific
requirements below.
2. Where a Resident with an OHIP billing number is providing insured services independently and
outside their training program, the insured service is not eligible for payment to a Supervising
Physician as there is no Supervision provided.
[Commentary:
In the scenario described above the Resident is not performing the service as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Resident would bill OHIP for the service provided.]
3. Where a Clinical Fellow with an OHIP billing number is providing insured services
independently and outside their training program, the insured service is not eligible for payment
to a Supervising Physician as there is no Supervision provided.
[Commentary:
In the scenario described above the Clinical Fellow is not performing the services as a Medical
Trainee. In this scenario, the Clinical Fellow would bill OHIP for the services provided. For
example, an orthopedic surgeon may be enrolled in a sarcoma surgery clinical fellowship but
has privileges as a general orthopedic surgeon and may perform, and be eligible for payment,
for rendering a service such as an open reduction of a fracture that is not being supervised by
a Supervising Physician.]
