B. Performing the anaesthetic procedure, and procedures associated with the anaesthetic procedure
which are not separately payable including providing all supportive measures to the patient during
and immediately after the period of anaesthesia; transfer of or assisting with the transfer of the
patient to the recovery room; all indicated recovery room procedures, and ongoing monitoring and
detention during the immediate post-operative and recovery period.
C. Making arrangements for any assessments, procedures, or therapy, including obtaining any
specimens (except for arterial puncture Z459), and/or interpreting the results, on matters related to
the service.
D. Making, or supervising the making of, arrangements for follow-up care and when medically
indicated, post-procedure monitoring of the patient’s condition until the next insured service is
provided.
E. Discussion with, and providing any advice and information, including prescribing therapy to the
patient or the patient’s representative, whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to the
service.
F. Providing premises, equipment, supplies, and personnel for any aspect(s) of specific elements A,
C, D, and E that is (are) performed in a place other than the place in which the general anaesthetic
service is performed.
While no occasion may arise for performing elements C, D or E, when performed in connection with
the other specific elements, they are included in the general anaesthetic service.
The general anaesthesia service includes:
a. a pre-anaesthetic evaluation, with specific elements as for assessments (see GP15);
b. the anaesthetic procedure; and
c. post-anaesthetic follow-up.
Note:
1.With the exception of the listings in the “Consultations and Visits” section, all references to an
anaesthesiologist in this Schedule are references to any physician providing anaesthetic
services.
2.As defined in the General Preamble (see GP2), general anaesthesia, for the purposes of this
Schedule, includes all forms of anaesthesia except local infiltration, unless otherwise
specifically listed.
CALCULATION OF FEE PAYABLE – BASIC AND TIME UNITS
The amount payable for the anaesthesia service is calculated by adding the number of basic and time
units and multiplying the total by the anaesthesiologist unit fee.
Anaesthesiologist Unit fee .................................................. $15.49
Basic Units: The number of basic units is the number of basic units listed opposite the service in the
column headed with “Anae” except,

ANAESTHESIOLOGISTS’ SERVICES
a. where multiple or bilateral surgical procedures are performed during the same anaesthetic,
the number of basic units listed in the column headed with “Anae” opposite the service that
describes the major procedure; or
b. where the basic units are listed as IC, or where no basic units are listed, the amount payable
is calculated by adding the appropriate time units to the basic units listed for a comparable
procedure (taking into account the region, modifying conditions, or techniques).
Time Units: Time units are calculated on the basis of time spent by the anaesthesiologist and
commence when the anaesthesiologist is first in attendance with the patient in the OR for the purpose
of initiating anaesthesia and end when the anaesthesiologist is no longer in attendance (when the
patient may safely be placed under customary post-operative supervision). Time units are calculated
for each 15 minutes or part thereof. The unit value of each 15 minute period or part thereof is:
During the first hour ................................................................ 1 unit
After the first hour up to and including the first 1.5 hours ....... 2 units
After 1.5 hours ........................................................................ 3 units
Claims submission instruction:
Submit claims for anaesthesia services rendered with a surgical procedure using the suffix “C”, with
the procedural code.
[Commentary:
see Appendix H for a table stating the duration of the anaesthesia service and corresponding
time units.]

CANCELLED SURGERY - ANAESTHESIA SERVICES
Payment rules:
1. If an anaesthesiologist examines a patient prior to surgery and the surgery is cancelled prior to
the induction of anaesthesia, the service rendered constitutes a hospital subsequent visit.
2. When an anaesthetic has begun but the operation is cancelled prior to commencement of
surgery, the service constitutes E006C with the actual number of time units added to 6 basic
units for this service.
[Commentary:
If the operation is cancelled after surgery has commenced, the amount payable is calculated by
adding the listed procedural basic units plus time units and multiplying the total by the unit fee.]
SECOND ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
Unless otherwise specified in the Schedule, when the anaesthetic services of more than one
anaesthesiologist are necessary in the interest of the patient, the service provided by the second
anaesthesiologist constitutes E001C with the actual number of time units (based on the actual time
assisting the first anaesthesiologist) added to 6 basic units.
REPLACEMENT ANAESTHESIOLOGIST
When one anaesthesiologist starts a procedure and is replaced by another anaesthesiologist (“the
replacement anaesthesiologist”) during a surgical procedure or delivery:
a. the amount payable to the first anaesthesiologist is calculated by adding the listed
procedural basic units plus time units for the time the first anaesthesiologist is in attendance;
b. except in the case of continuous conduction anaesthesia, the service provided by the
replacement anaesthesiologist constitutes E005C based on the actual number of time units
and 6 basic units.
Note:
E005C qualifies for the premiums E400C or E401C only if the case commences after hours
(see GP94).
[Commentary:
1.Each anaesthesiologist must indicate, as part of the medical record, his/her starting and
finishing times.
2.For continuous conduction anaesthesia, the replacement anaesthesiologist submits claims
using the applicable continuous conduction anaesthesia fee code.]
OBSTETRICS – CONTINUOUS CONDUCTION ANAESTHESIA
P014C, introduction of a catheter for labour analgesia, including the first dose of medication with or
without any combined spinal-epidural injection(s), has a value of 7 basic units.
P016C time units for maintenance of obstetrical epidural anaesthesia are calculated on the basis of 1
unit for each ½ hour of time to a maximum of 12 units.
E100C time units for attendance at delivery are calculated on the basis of 4 base units and 1 unit for
each ¼ hour

Note:
E025C is only eligible for payment for an unanticipated transfusion of blood during a surgical
procedure where:
1.greater than 70 ml/kg of red blood cells are transfused for a patient with a weight up to 50 kg;
or
2.10 or more units of red blood cells are transfused for a patient with a weight exceeding 50 kg.
[Commentary:
1.For E010, BMI is calculated by dividing the patient’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of
the patient’s height (in metres).
2.E025C is defined by the amount of blood transfused rather than the amount of blood loss.
The volume of blood transfused does not include blood collected from a cell saver,
hemodilution techniques or non-red blood cell components.]
Payment rules:
1. In the description of E022C, E016C, E017C and E020C, reference to ASA level for Physical
Status Classification means the level determined by the anaesthesiologist at the time of the pre-
operative anaesthesia assessment.
[Commentary:
The level determined above does not vary, for example, when complications arise during
surgery.]
2. E016C, E017C and E020C are not eligible for payment when anaesthesia is rendered to a brain
dead patient for organ donations.

[Commentary:
1.Deep sedation, general anaesthesia or regional anaesthesia, performed by an
anaesthesiologist, are examples of anaesthesia that may be rendered for E023C and E032C.
2.Anaesthesia extra units listed on GP97 are eligible for payment with E023C and E032C.
3.Local infiltration or topical anaesthesia used as an anaesthetic for any procedure is not
eligible for payment.]
Note:
For the purposes of anaesthesia services the following definitions apply:
1.Procedural Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients
respond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light tactile
stimulation. No interventions are required to maintain a patent airway, and spontaneous
ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
2.Deep Sedation is a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients cannot
be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful stimulation. The
ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be impaired. Patients may require
assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation may be inadequate.
Cardiovascular function is usually maintained.
3.General Anaesthesia is a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not
arousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory
function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in maintaining a patent airway,
and positive pressure ventilation may be required because of depressed spontaneous
ventilation or drug-induced depression of neuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function
may be impaired.
ANAESTHESIA ADMINISTERED BY SAME PHYSICIAN PERFORMING A PROCEDURE
1. Except as described in paragraph 2, when a physician administers an anaesthetic, nerve block
and/or other medication prior to, during, immediately after or otherwise in conjunction with a
diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure which the physician performs on the same patient,
the administration of the anaesthetic, nerve block and/or other medication is not eligible for
payment.

2. A major or minor peripheral nerve block, major plexus block, neuraxial injection (with or without
catheter) or intrapleural block (with or without catheter) for post-operative pain control (with a
duration of action more than 4 hours) is eligible for payment as G224 when rendered in
conjunction with a procedure which the physician performs on the same patient. With the
exception of a bilateral pudendal block (where only one service is eligible for payment), G224 is
eligible for payment once per region per side where bilateral procedures are performed.
