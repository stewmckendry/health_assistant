GENERAL PREAMBLE
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF ASSESSMENTS
In addition to the common elements, all services which are described as assessments, or as including
assessments (e.g. consultations), include the following specific elements:
A. A direct physical encounter with the patient including taking a patient history and performing a
physical examination.
B. Other inquiry (including taking a patient history), carried out to arrive at an opinion as to the nature
of the patient’s condition, (whether such inquiry takes place before, during or after the encounter
during which the physical examination takes place) and/or follow-up care.
C. Performing any procedure(s) during the same encounter as the physical examination, unless the
procedure(s) is(are) separately listed in the Schedule and an amount is payable for the procedure
in conjunction with an assessment.
“Procedure” in this context includes obtaining specimens, preparation of the patient, interpretation
of results and, unless otherwise specified, all diagnostic (including laboratory) and therapeutic
(including surgical) services;
D. Making arrangements for any related assessments, procedures or therapy, and/or interpreting
results.
E. Making arrangements for follow-up care.
F. Discussion with, and providing advice and information, including prescribing therapy to the patient
or the patient’s representative, whether by telephone or otherwise, on matters related to:
1. the service; and
2. in circumstances in which it would be professionally appropriate that results can be reported
upon prior to any further patient visit, the results of related procedure(s) and/or assessment(s).
G. When medically indicated, monitoring the condition of the patient and intervening, until the next
insured service is provided.
H. Providing premises, equipment, supplies, and personnel for the specific elements of the service
except for any aspect(s) that is (are) performed in a hospital or nursing home.
While no occasion may arise for performing elements C, D, E, G, or H, when performed in connection
with the other specific elements, they are included in the assessment.
