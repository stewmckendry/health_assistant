# Dr. OPA Agent Semantic Search Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-09-25

## Summary
Successfully replaced SQL text search with semantic Vector → Rerank → Filter algorithm. All MCP tools now use pure semantic search with LLM reranking for improved relevance.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Search Algorithm Replacement
- **Before**: SQL LIKE queries + Vector search in parallel
- **After**: Vector search → LLM reranking → Metadata filtering
- **Benefit**: Semantic understanding of queries instead of exact text matching

### 2. New Components Added
- `SemanticSearchEngine` class in `/src/agents/dr_opa_agent/mcp/search/semantic_search.py`
- LLM reranking using GPT-4o-mini for relevance scoring
- Comprehensive logging at each search stage

### 3. MCP Tools Updated
- ✅ `opa.search_sections` - Using semantic search
- ✅ `opa.policy_check` - Using semantic search  
- ✅ `opa.ipac_guidance` - Using semantic search
- ✅ `opa.clinical_tools` - Using semantic search (per user feedback)
- ℹ️ `opa.program_lookup` - Still uses SQL (structured data lookup)
- ℹ️ `opa.freshness_probe` - Still uses SQL (metadata check)

## Test Results

### Test 1: Search Sections
**Query**: "telemedicine documentation requirements"
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
- Found 5 relevant sections
- Returned Medical Records Documentation, Third Party Medical Reports, Consent to Treatment policies
- No exact phrase match needed - semantic understanding worked

### Test 2: Policy Check
**Query**: "virtual care consent"
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
- Found 15 policies/advice documents
- Correctly identified Virtual Care and Consent to Treatment policies
- High confidence score (0.91)
- Properly categorized as expectations vs advice

### Test 3: Clinical Tools
**Query**: "dementia"
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
- Found 20 clinical tools
- Primary result: Dementia Diagnosis tool with algorithm, checklist, and assessment features
- Also returned related mental health and substance use tools
- Semantic search understood the clinical context

## Performance Observations

### Search Quality
- **Semantic Understanding**: Queries now understand intent and synonyms
- **Relevance**: LLM reranking significantly improves result quality
- **Coverage**: Finds related documents even without exact keyword matches

### Logging Output
Each search now logs:
1. Initial query and filters
2. Vector search candidate count
3. Reranking scores for top documents
4. Final result count after filtering

Example log output:
```
=== SEMANTIC SEARCH START ===
Query: telemedicine documentation requirements
Step 1: Vector Search - Retrieving candidates...
Vector search returned 50 candidates
Step 2: LLM Reranking - Scoring relevance...
Top 3 reranked results: [9.2, 8.7, 8.3]
Step 3: Metadata Filtering - Applying constraints...
=== SEMANTIC SEARCH COMPLETE: Returning 5 results ===
```

## Issues Resolved

1. **Empty Results Problem**: SQL LIKE queries were returning empty results for natural language queries
2. **Field Name Mismatch**: Fixed mapping between semantic search results and MCP response models
3. **Confidence Calculation**: Updated to work with single search approach (no SQL/Vector conflicts)

## Recommendations

### For Dr. OFF Agent
Based on successful implementation in Dr. OPA:

1. **Adopt Semantic Search for Documents**: Use same Vector → Rerank → Filter approach for all document/guidance searches
2. **Keep SQL for Structured Data**: Maintain SQL for DINs, OHIP codes, fee schedules
3. **Share SemanticSearchEngine**: Consider moving to shared library for consistency

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Test remaining MCP tools with various queries
2. ✅ Monitor logs for performance metrics
3. ⏳ Consider caching LLM reranking results for common queries
4. ⏳ Fine-tune reranking prompts for medical domain

## Conclusion
The semantic search implementation successfully addresses the fundamental limitation of SQL text search for natural language queries. The system now understands user intent and finds relevant medical guidance even when exact phrases don't match.
